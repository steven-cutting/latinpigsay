paragraphs = """For many people (myself among them), the Python language is easy to fall in love with.
Since its first appearance in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular dynamic,
programming languages, along with Perl, Ruby, and others. Python and Ruby have
become especially popular in recent years for building websites using their numerous
web frameworks, like Rails (Ruby) and Django (Python). Such languages are often
called scripting languages as they can be used to write quick-and-dirty small programs,
or scripts. I don’t like the term “scripting language” as it carries a connotation that they
cannot be used for building mission-critical software. Among interpreted languages
Python is distinguished by its large and active scientific computing community. 
Adoption of Python for scientific computing in both industry applications and academic
research has increased significantly since the early 2000s.

For data analysis and interactive, exploratory computing and data visualization, Python
will inevitably draw comparisons with the many other domain-specific open source
and commercial programming languages and tools in wide use, such as R, MATLAB,
SAS, Stata, and others. In recent years, Python’s improved library support (primarily
pandas) has made it a strong alternative for data manipulation tasks. Combined with
Python’s strength in general purpose programming, it is an excellent choice as a single
language for building data-centric applications.
