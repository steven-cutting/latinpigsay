paragraphs = """For many people (myself among them), the Python language is easy to fall in love with.
Since its first appearance in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular dynamic,
programming languages, along with Perl, Ruby, and others. Python and Ruby have
become especially popular in recent years for building websites using their numerous
web frameworks, like Rails (Ruby) and Django (Python). Such languages are often
called scripting languages as they can be used to write quick-and-dirty small programs,
or scripts. I don’t like the term “scripting language” as it carries a connotation that they
cannot be used for building mission-critical software. Among interpreted languages
Python is distinguished by its large and active scientific computing community.
Adoption of Python for scientific computing in both industry applications and academic
research has increased significantly since the early 2000s.

For data analysis and interactive, exploratory computing and data visualization, Python
will inevitably draw comparisons with the many other domain-specific open source
and commercial programming languages and tools in wide use, such as R, MATLAB,
SAS, Stata, and others. In recent years, Python’s improved library support (primarily
pandas) has made it a strong alternative for data manipulation tasks. Combined with
Python’s strength in general purpose programming, it is an excellent choice as a single
language for building data-centric applications.

The Gettysburg Address

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent,
a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all
men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as
a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate - we cannot consecrate - we cannot
hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before
us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve
that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by
the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
