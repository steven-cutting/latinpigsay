 PRAETOR?S LUNCH

 By DOM

 The ancient magistrate is having lunch at noon and these are our attempts at capturing his thoughts in the midst of dining. Thoughts are expressed in both verse and prose form.

 Take this morsel by morsel.

 FIRST MORSEL

 We wish an end to war with promises and hopes of peace. We wish for peace ,we prepare for war. We threaten peace of others with war. We rouse ourselves with the cry to arms. In peace or war we are restless. In peace we amuse ourselves by sparring and wargames .In war we sing our lamentations of peace.

 What are we ? A warlike race intent on keeping an empire with abundance .At the same time advance in all directions with our might.

 The horns of bulls are never far from another warring bull?s tips. When reins are loosened, gates thrown wide ,beasts lunge forth and lock horns again. Mars. Venus. Ares. Aphrodite. Their temples are extremes. We invoke their benison at various stages of life.

 Nature. Choice. Reason. They hatch outcome. We?re capable of breathing life force and personify the two exorbitant passions. There is another passion but its sedateness hardly qualifies it for that intense term. It is more an affliction. We are within range of it too. This frigid indifference.

 SECOND MORSEL

 All will have their day. The thwarted, triumphant. The Gods ,their final say. All will be, whatever they may be. What soothsayers are privy to ,what the oracle withholds. The gods intervene, they alter destinies. It all rests on the will of the Being who wields the armoury of Nature and reins of the universe.

 Miltiades and Alexander crushed the might of armed Persian pride. Marathon and Salamis undid Darius and Xerxes.

 Patroclus wasn?t meant to sack Troy. Struck by Apollo, slain by Hector. Menelaus could have slain Paris but his sword broke. Paris though defeated was spared by Aphrodite who returned him to Trojan lines.

 Pandarus? arrow injured Agamemnon . That one arrow aggravated the wounds of Greeks. Troy was meant to fall .

 Poseidon shielded Aeneas from the furious sword of Achilles. Rome was meant to be.

 THIRD MORSEL

 View of evening and morning are crowning achievements of nature?s light and shadow play. The rest of the day is a hiatus between splendour. We need to live through and endure the rest of it like life. Between glory and triumph, there are those simple times which we seldom note or cherish. Times of neither sadness or gladness. Existential. Not piquant vividness of acute alertness.

 FOURTH MORSEL

 To bear the fruits of victory and to have the muscle of vanquished people, the state has to continually nurture a nation of courageous loyal citizens. Conquest has to be maintained, watched by ever vigilant sentries and keepers. The state neither needs nor reveres idlers whose business is to indulge themselves in Bacchanalian excesses on account of their ancestry to heroes of preceding generations.

 Lawmakers duel with wit, logic and words while the war machine duels with tools of the army .Laws made or repealed as fearless scions fight for aspirations of a greater state.

 To safeguard the abundance of far flung regions brought for the enjoyment of the homeland. Have the names of conquerors venerated by the conquered people. Have kings, queens and chieftains of unknown lands pay tribute to the imperial standard.

 FIFTH MORSEL

 Two friends. They talk of things past, of bets against each other. They laud things, condemn a few and lampoon absurdities.

 They try things out , chalk up mutual experiences .Argue in good humour. They are both the core of their world. All else backdrops. There are friendships which rival or surpass the closeness of blood relations.

 Other lives about them are ambience to their drama of life. All that the world holds enrich their learning. They have their own company to increase their happiness. They help themselves and with relish exhaust the time granted.

 SIXTH MORSEL

 Morning recedes.

 Noon emerges.

 Up on the bridge ,the cobbled passage below, the sun nigh. Breeze blows mildly. Dries noon swelter dry. A column on the march .At the outskirts of the garrison town, clatter of horses, armed men of war and metal are accustomed sounds , familiar sights.

 Javelins high , tips glinting. Clear without scarlet stains of battle or rust of war. Chins up. Feet in perfect stride. Sturdy steps in unison.

 Bouncing blades , sheathed in their scabbards. Jangling armour as leather soles stamp the stone tiled road.

 Neighing mounts , tasselled reins, governed by their masters, they gallop obediently. Shields glint. Their helmets of war inject ferocity to their visages.

 Meridian peaks.

 Morn recedes.

 The proud standard borne by its bearer. Beast?s paws knotted at his chest. Beast?s maw agape from the top of his helmet till rear curvature of his neck. Fangs in line with temples. His cohorts , the horn blowers ride nearby. The visibility and density of dyed tufts discern common soldier from centurion, centurion from officer.

 Red cloaks clasped and drape imperiously over backs of the empire?s officials. Saddled snugly atop their mounts, towards destination ,advance. To the horizon ,another outpost awaits them. Keeping their presence seen and felt. Mere manoeuvres .Necessary routine.

 Town square forums and resthouses. Aqueducts and baths of villas. They must forego these comforts. They are duty bound for now.

 Daylight recedes.

 Evening emerges.

 SEVENTH MORSEL

 Prosperity has many friends and many envious schemers who duck at blind corners . Comrades and kin trumpet deeds . Generosity towards common masses too gains favour .We?ll know it when the market place speak of none but the doer . To detractors, motives are questioned unflaggingly .

 Any hint of misdemeanour or misstep , the forum echoes with it with the zeal equalled only by the homecoming of a victor crowned with honours except it?s ill distinction and not exalted honour.

 Whisperings at public baths , hastened steps towards or away from the object of their speculation .

 Some will speak well of them. Some will be too distant to know them well enough to dislike or to be fond of with conviction sprung from familiarity. Prosperity puts a person on different plain yet this dagger is just as sharp on both sides for the one is also vulnerable to the critical eye of scrutiny.

 Doubts, beliefs , suspicions and truths addled with syllables which make a name. Common populace , will they choose to know the truth and live with the measure of a human being or swallow myth and live with the flight of legend ? That shall be determined by conduct , attainments , favourable circumstances and an orator?s persuasive logic.

 EIGHTH MORSEL

 Fear their leaders more than their faceless enemies . Guard the standard as if it were one?s life .A source of pride to be defended. In all manner of weather or even in peace

 the play of battle fills the gap of idleness.

 Hardened muscles are not to grow soft and feeble.

 Barbaric tribes of east and west. Threats to outer reaches of reign. There our garrisons cannot rest their tools . Craggy mountains and treacherous forests are home to nomadic tribes which live to hunt and plunder , wild like their wilderness dwellings.

 They have neither patience nor skill to cultivate the land. They are not of that ilk.

 Cities and orderliness are strange to them. They are curiosities amongst us .We are game in their company.

 They see our numbers and strength .They do not venture forth . An uneasy peace simply broken by the party which is the first to charge , cry out and first to snatch their arms out of their housing .

 NINTH MORSEL

 ?Quot homines tot sententiae.?

 So many people so many opinions. The voice of the leader slices across the indiscernible chatter. All persuading , nobly commanding . A clear voice brings with it a defined course. The rest obey , they lack the chief?s possessions. ?Qualis Rex talis grex?. Such is the leader , such is the people. One?s virtues are taken note of .The most ardent admirers mold themselves to that manner. What their leaders do and and do not. Whatever those venerated say or withhold. There are imitators , emulators , travesty smiths. Once in a while , one or a small band of them rise to remold status quo. A wave is hatched and unleashed .It becomes an acceptable convention. It is the manner of people that which is proven will be used till the spring is parched or when something superior is offered and that offering tickles their longing. Far easier to remain constant than alter a course. Given the disposition toward ease , the well trodden tempts .Yet heed well that it is the passage of tribulation where the coronet of glory and honour rests on the head of those who are uncowed .They shall find that fame latches like their own skin to their name .

 TENTH MORSEL

 We who hold the torch

 We must be patient

 Decorum requires it

 The pride of a legion

 lives within its standard

 one standard bearer bears

 sacrament of cohorts

 We who hold the torch

 We must be patient

 Decorum requires it

 One official?s carriage

 personifies the rest

 one written inscription

 ultimate seal of fate

 We who hold the torch

 We must be patient

 Decorum requires it

 Make way for those better

 while we wait with patience

 allow them the better seats

 their merit exceed ours

 ELEVENTH MORSEL

 I am not one to dispute the will of God ,

 divine will becomes our lot ,

 but I question the logic of some .

 Foolish is the soul who enters the place ,

 who announces his innermost desires ,

 swears a gift in return ,

 should they be fulfilled ,

 by divine consent ,

 upon his earthly cares ,

 mortal souls have none to offer better ,

 than the rewards of paradise ,

 what are our trappings to heaven ,

 when it is God who grants ?

 It is not worship or invocation ,

 it is a wager posed by hubris ,

 displace pomposity and affectation ,

 come in a penitent pose ,

 humility warrants attention ,

 or else snuff the lamp ,

 take the oil elsewhere .

 I am not one to dispute the will of God ,

 divine will becomes our lot ,

 but I question the right of tyrants .

 Charred cities after their sacking ,

 the cries of dependent humanity ,

 sent to feed searing flames ,

 the weak , meek and lame ,

 no daylight dawns again ,

 a winding trail of chains and clubs ,

 the gathered wounded ; conquered ,

 these tyrants do not govern ,

 they seize and consume their fill ,

 then hunger rumbles again ,

 they repeat their atrocities ,

 till the Fates pluck them .

 For each tyrant reaped ,

 by droves victims precede them ,

 their number exceed sacrificial offerings ,

 made to appease wrathful spirits ,

 or custom of ceremony ,

 of a deity worshipped .

 TWELFTH MORSEL

 Our moments of glory

 a lifetime to remember

 fair token of youth?s vigour

 Carve now before the die sets

 while still new and pliable

 when it dries your mark stays

 hardened and nobly set

 surpassing life of wilted crowns

 a monument in your honour

 Our moments of glory

 a lifetime to remember

 come pay heed to youth?s prayer

 We won?t be here to bother

 having surpassed such worries

 earthborn to earth it goes

 like Assyrian ruins

 to those with merits deserving

 God and kind Fortune preserve them

 Our moments of glory

 a lifetime to remember

 mementos of youth?s flower

 THIRTEENTH MORSEL

 A peasant who wishes for more

 changes his plough for arms

 The army has loyal farmers

 with absent fathers away far

 Children of empire?s troops

 though honoured their father?s name

 they hardly know the man well

 though his name they proudly bear

 Years abroad have rendered fathers

 estranged from families and friends

 yet love and regard still remain

 after gaps of years and distance

 A peasant who wishes for more

 changes his plough for arms

 fertile fields left idle

 while we take grain from conquered lands

 For children whom fathers left

 when they were too young to recall

 esteem comes to their hearts prior

 before the warmth of filial love

 At long last parted faces meet again

 strange and familiar strange yet familiar

 they rekindle ties and retell tidings

 memories and previous habits return

 Fertile fields left idle

 while we take grain from conquered lands

 the army has its own farmers

 with absent fathers battling far

 Families once again reunited

 when warriors in togas turn civilians

 their children venture and nestle gladly

 FOURTEENTH MORSEL

 ?De mortuis nil nisi bonum?

 speak well of the departed

 or else do not speak at all .

 The now sacred departed

 immune to our rebuke

 rejoice with their memory.

 ?De mortuis nil nisi bonum?

 speak well of the departed

 or else do not speak at all .

 Allow their good part live on

 they have gone beyond the gates

 those whom we regard dearly.

 FIFTEENTH MORSEL

 What draws us to oracles ?

 Those structures where we worship ,

 The place where future unfolds ,

 For those who are uncertain ,

 Gripped by Trouble?s tentacles .

 What draws us to oracles ?

 Priests and priestesses reveal ,

 With omniscience in their being ,

 With eyes of the temple gods ,

 Free from earthly manacles .

 SIXTEENTH MORSEL

 There is nothing loathsome ,

 in learning from others ,

 with elders and with peers ,

 we shared experiences ,

 treasures of our youth ,

 amusing in retrospect .

 It is the matter?s worth

 the source dictates not choice

 progress comes not from disdain

 to live we nourish the form

 to advance we emulate

 the source dictates not choice

 It is the matter?s worth

 If they should enrich us ,

 ennoble the manner ,

 magnify happiness ,

 increase our contentment ,

 in learning from others ,

 there is nothing loathsome .

 SEVENTEENTH MORSEL

 For common good and for own glory

 a seat in the senate

 For common cause and own aspirations

 a seat in the senate

 For power over destinies for by themselves they'll drown

 a seat in the senate

 For a hand in fate and privilege to avert a few unpleasantries a seat in the senate

 For the pristine tunic and the challenge to keep it unsoiled a seat in the senate

 For rhetoric comes with quandaries of office

 a seat in the senate

 The toga is equal in prestige with the weight of armour

 a seat in the senate

 EIGHTEENTH MORSEL

 Arena gladiators

 with their lives amuse us

 liberty bought with blood

 the last one is set free.

 Slaves of silver mines

 they crawl in tunnels dark

 they live with the terror

 of cave-ins and landslides .

 Privilege of victory

 marked by thriving slavery

 of people subjugated.

 The nameless galley slaves

 unpaid naval oarsmen

 chained to oars in battle

 live or drown with the ship.

 Slaves who serve the household

 by bonded servitude

 are bound to their masters

 for their food and lodging.

 Our state's territory

 with empire's history

 adorned with places conquered.

 NINETEENTH MORSEL

 PORTION I

 callow upstarts

 those who dare advise

 hindrances to them

 callow upstarts

 heedless of counsel

 unfelled by the mace

 uncut by the blade

 young and rash

 callow upstarts

 they shall not avert

 except the obvious

 PORTION II

 To the philosopher

 thoughts and writings

 are his close friends

 he sees to needs

 he then dotes on

 work and study

 To the philosopher

 thoughts and writings

 are his dear friends

 exile?s release

 from sycophants

 wary of him

 TWENTIETH MORSEL

 Emotion in the thick of bandying

 Eloquence is reduced to instinct

 The will to survive repeats in mind

 Asserts itself amidst the bedlam

 Barbaric ululations and cries

 Enemy?s breath and blows on the flesh

 Attack..defend..retaliate..avenge

 Advance..retreat..encircle..scatter

 There is no room to mourn the fallen

 While in the midst of war?s grim reaping

 Those destined to live long and see much

 Shall live and thrive long after youth?s bloom .

 TWENTY FIRST MORSEL

 One class wash clothing

 inside common pools

 with scent and reek of others? washing

 One class have clothing

 cleaned inside clear pools

 water stored in lavish amphoraes

 Disparity exists

 even in the city of the world

 A part of the city

 is alive when the sun is out

 A part of the city

 languishes in darkness at dusk

 The beast of disparity

 also dwells and lurks in Rome

 Garrisons guard borders ever vigilantly

 behind stone slabs of sturdy fortress walls

 But it is too risky to take a walk at night

 in the city without armed entourage

 One quarter boasts stone and marble

 One quarter built from brick and wood

 Disparity exists

 even in the city of the world

 Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want, as it appears in our Newsletters.

 Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+ If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.

 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

 At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks. We need funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain or increase our production and reach our goals.

 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

 As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

 We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones that have responded.

 As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states. Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

 In answer to various questions we have received on this:

 We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have, just ask.

 While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to

 donate.

 International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about

 how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are ways.

 Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

 Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

 the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-622154. Donations are

 tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law. As fundraising

 requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.
