 RHYME AND REASON

 VOLUME TWO

 BY Dom

 A complement and continuation to the compilation, 'RHYME AND REASON'.

 Dedicated to the cherished and cheeky peeps.

 Bravo ! :

 You speak to one and speak to all

 Our minds ye have gracefully touched

 In joy we leap and misery we crawl

 But in Belief and Faith we have much

 8>)

 The '99 Blues (composed in 1999) :

 Then garrisons marched out to conquer

 half the world ruled from the center

 with mastery of steel and agility

 discipline ensured victory

 in the reign of conquerors

 just a few millenniums ago

 The sea a vast briny divide

 civilization still ruled by the tide

 then brave explorers discovered

 new lands and the people conquered

 their stake upon immortality

 for the homeland's glory

 just a few centuries ago

 Red flag and sickle brought down a throne

 when planes first battled and droned

 world wars twice a century

 during the first half

 the Cold War ended

 just over a decade ago

 We're not getting closer

 even as we get older

 resorted to arms

 negotiations crumbled

 talk in shambles

 just a few years ago

 News still blaring strife and scandal

 weight of troubles for the willing and able

 to cleanse this world of ailments

 do we seek the new fangled or ancient ?

 we're still searching

 just a few days ago

 Neighbourhood bustles with communal fussing

 jobs, relations, children, gossip and bragging

 folks I know and don't chattering

 I have the alcohol's fire in my veins

 from the drinks I had

 just a few hours ago

 My thoughts flip back to friends I had

 times of delight and mirth made me glad

 then commitments led us away

 catch up with you soon

 I was in the past

 just a minute ago

 8>)

 Passage Of His Reign :

 Supple youth gambols with fresh breeze.

 Fledgling seeds sprout first roots.

 First light flickers from the horizon.

 Winds blow with a shrill.

 His reign is ascending.

 Seasoned vigour reads the seasons.

 Roots rush to claim its share of the earth.

 Torch of day hangs midway at meridian's hour.

 Winds howl deeply.

 His reign at its apex.

 What was once a peak is now a plain.

 The next crest yields a basin of troughs.

 Howling winds bewray cracks.

 Ripe form moves with care.

 Old roots are gnarled.

 Light of day is a humble blend of glow and grey.

 Winds howl at slurred pace.

 His reign at its ebb.

 8>)

 No. 14 :

 He's been up and over the hill

 He's lost the horizon

 He can't see the end

 to his plateau limbo

 The parade of younger generations

 excite him they do not

 he knows the game

 the tools have long changed

 he a hapless victim

 of the course of regulations

 which write off able bodied people

 on set biological years

 not on account of physical decline

 He wastes away

 He's been up and over the hill

 Bereft of direction

 He's lost the horizon

 which guided previous phases of his life

 A man in retirement

 without lifelong passion

 outside the sphere of his career

 hastens his own decline

 He can't see the end

 to his plateau limbo

 8>)

 Worth Of Say :

 Everybody's worth of say

 heard in haunts you roam

 Someone else's worth of say

 overheard as you flit by

 It's not your worth of say

 while you stand, watch and wait

 You want your worth of say

 before pale flag's hoisted

 the towel thrown

 Everybody's worth of say

 in each twist of rhetoric

 Someone else's worth of say

 you cannot see your name

 It's not your worth of say

 you haven't spoken yet

 You want your worth of say

 before the heart's lost

 the daredevils retire

 Everybody's worth of say

 as you glean the scene

 Someone else's worth of say

 while you keep your peace

 It's not your worth of say

 when others speak their mind

 You want your worth of say

 before the flames flake

 the embers melt

 8>)

 Illustration Of Melancholy:

 'I saw your face , It was clouded by smoke

 I grasped the smoke, and inhaled despair

 Was I too late ? Am I just in time

 for one last remorse

 and to scream myself hoarse

 robbed of the thrill of a dare

 The wheels turn with a broken spoke '

 8>)

 For A Friend's Recovery :

 My heart leaps at your recovery

 Peaks and troughs you did scale

 Ease towards hearty and hale

 Soon you'll return to normalcy

 8>)

 Progeny :

 Flesh of one's flesh

 Blood of one's blood

 nature and learning mesh

 where two create a third

 8>)

 I'm Leaving :

 Goodbye there's a pensive stillness

 A short while to reflect the jolt

 There's a blithe smile of carelessness

 A short pause to fasten the bolt

 8>)

 Action Required :

 Thoughts that lodge in me

 should I bolt them and forget ?

 should I say them and release ?

 this quandary baits me

 with a jerk of regret

 Questions play within me

 should I price their logic ?

 should I leave them be ?

 this quandary baits me

 with care I am to pick

 Resolve swells in me

 I should heed apprehension !

 I should calm uncertainty !

 the last stroke awaits me

 with an expectation

 8>)

 Little One's Hope :

 Your tiny feet stumble and knees buckle

 yet you walk with outstretched arms

 Your hands grapple at awkward angles

 yet you come with curious arms

 Child of hope and child of trust

 Shape your future with our past

 8>)

 A Toast To Thee :

 though the distance for miles swell

 much from Fortune we can't tell

 savour rewards and joys we had

 while sweat and toil made us prepared

 your quests ahead, I wish you well

 8>)

 Whimsical Verse :

 There was a lady of wavy long tresses

 who pined for short locks of hair

 so to her wish she one day addresses

 and was delighted by a sight so fair!

 8>)

 A weave of thanks :

 'twas inspired by inspiration

 I thank thee for thy plaudit

 where reason and words meet

 'tis to me a joyous notion

 with words Bards shape and weave

 while from the Muses they receive !

 8>)

 Quatrain For Friends :

 In friendship and in sport

 Trust and faith scaled the fort

 In light jest and with truth

 Hands clasp with regard true

 8>)

 The World Turns :

 for as long as the world turns

 there'll be cause to go on

 along its twists and turns

 from night to new morn

 sparks alight where fire burns

 warm embraces and cold spurns

 events that press us upon

 when cause and effect churns

 while hopes and chances spawn

 sadness and joy have their turns

 there'll be cause to go on

 for as long as the world turns

 8>)

 Pricey Temptation :

 Sell us your finest finery

 To cheer up lively livery

 the earthly passing passions

 tempt with comely compulsions

 8>)

 Your Move :

 where does your heart lie ?

 when it must be true ?

 the hard questions they pry

 and they are now due !

 to salvation where you're cleansed ?

 or reap damnation of recompense ?

 judge and make fateful choice

 foolish plunge or righteous poise !

 8>)

 Restless Reckless :

 Mesh of contradictions

 with likely predilections

 flirting with chance

 in a worldly prance

 Providence queried with questions varied

 in a rush hurried of temper unburied

 Toasts to eventuality

 with a toss of probability

 come fame or infamy

 taunts decreed mortality

 8>)

 Three Thoughts at Three Paces :

 1

 For what is a lavish bauble

 but sight to behold and marvel ?

 It cares not how you fare

 merely a trinket to compare ?

 2

 Mock not the spartan or ornate

 swiftly in haste or in debate

 With stealth change alters priorities

 makes necessary, luxuries

 makes luxuries, necessities

 A restless evolving state

 fills or wipes a slate

 3

 Spare traders of things necessary

 for their lack of tasteful grace

 Their use and place have longevity

 with wares to ease passing days

 8>)

 Some Questions(while Hope still waits) :

 1

 Will sworn foes swear anew

 be seated on common pew ?

 though far easier to renounce strangers

 bad blood among same blood breeds dangers

 2

 Will sworn foes swear anew

 be seated on common pew ?

 or will peace be only enforced

 when each choose a separate course ?

 3

 Will sworn foes swear anew

 be seated on common pew ?

 or must ill churn till last breath

 with no certainty but death ?

 4

 By own accord, jettison pride

 Courage on a limb, bare one's hide

 If sincerity resides on each side...

 5

 Will sworn foes swear anew

 be seated on common pew ?

 if oaths can be retaken

 can they embrace as brethren ?

 8>)

 Passing Days :

 Cry for joy and sorrow

 Yet lay hope for morrow

 Lift that blanket over you

 Till grass is wet with dew

 Lift your head to a new morn

 you'll be long way from forlorn

 greet sunrise with relish

 bid sunset with a wish

 8>)

 A Year Of Changes :

 A year of welcomes and partings

 short jaunts and long meanderings

 of prosaic and verse wanderings

 sustained efforts and constant dartings

 A year of comings and goings

 sure-footed steps and trippings

 swift stirrings and quiet mullings

 along known paths and new turnings

 8>)

 Another Round(for my friends) :

 Wishing you joys plenty and setbacks few

 Like the seasonal changes right on cue

 Friendship true cloys not but breathes anew

 Bursting with good faith and goodness due

 8>)

 Eight Lines :

 Things said are said fully

 Deeds done are done truly

 There shan't be lies to grieve

 If truth is like a sieve

 When wits are matched

 Our minds are lighted

 When sins are hatched

 Our joys are blighted

 8>)

 Dose Of Happiness :

 Feast on meals healthy and hearty

 moods brightened by fair company

 amidst weather fine and agreeable

 chosen activities are feasible

 with pleasant and peaceful repose

 awashed with life's joyful dose

 8>)

 Under The Influence :

 Resolute we are to mark treasures

 with length and breadth of finite measures

 as if their expanse explains indulgence

 where passion and devotion fuse at confluence

 8>)

 Grant Me A Moment :

 Grant me a moment its tarrying worth

 so I may savour my own lingering

 that later at length I could with mirth

 dub it a spell apt for remembering

 8>)

 The Best Seat :

 Seated amongst fondest of friends

 I took my place with much relish

 there's truth that happiness depends

 on presence of those we cherish

 8>)

 Simple Worship :

 Elaborate rituals and traditions serve to lengthen the divide between what believers wish to state and supposed obligations that come with prayers.More often than not, such rituals are man-made rules meant to lend mystical, mysterious air to worship. In fact how we worship is as bare knuckles as simple sincerity.

 Rituals and traditions do not enhance spiritual health of the faithful.They prolong the physical manifestation of worshipping taken to (at times)zealous and elitist degree. It bewilders those who approach religion with the aim of simple worship and sincere intimations.

 The imposition of man-made strictures and selfish interpretations magnifies the measure of spiritual desolation and logical confusion when welcome and solace are sought.

 It is hurtful and spiritually repulsive to have a monk, priest or medium severely chastise a worshipper for menial violations, made out of ignorance, for the common people are not as well schooled in so-called religious conventions. It is their duty to guide and courtesy to instruct. No believer and worshipper comes with willful intent to cause sacrilege. That goes against the purpose and effort of one's presence. Again, it is caused by the imposition of rituals and ceremony which causes the divide.

 A believer comes, settles in a prayerful pose and speaks one's heart, spills worries, mentions cares and wishes hopes for the numerous tomorrows ahead. It is a simple affirmation of faith and a private conversation with the Maker. What transpires in every session is a mutual secret between believer and Divine. A simple act that can be replicated at home in the confines of the room.

 8>)

 Savage Civilization :

 Known civilization was once overrun by wild tribes. Humanity once again threatens itself; by overrunning itself from within. When decency becomes an underground outlawed movement, if civilization glorifies its own demise and luxuriates in the stream of crumbling plaster and concrete, that is when the very term 'civilization' becomes a meaningless warble of groans.

 Before this desperate nightmare transmutes into hopeless reality, we need to pinch ourselves and come to our senses by putting our chaotic house in order. We are our own worst enemy and our likeliest saviour. 8>)

 Raindrops :

 Those who plan to go on foot bide time till lashing water slackens its vehemence upon the earth. Overfed sod forms mud puddles. Drenched concrete turn shades darker.

 Windows and screens are glazed with hazy film. Droplets streak randomly along crooked paths, from the steepest incline to the base. Trails of clear watery streaks slice through round and oval drops , speedily and decisively, like drunken comets.

 8>)

 Circumstantial Standpoint :

 It's nothing but circumstances between us. Circumstances determine who orders the charge and who charges, who lords over all and who the servants are, who rests atop pedestals and who shoulder their weight, who stands on the rostrum and who stand on the plains.

 Mere circumstances divide us. They determine who bears the moral responsibility, who does or refrain from the deed, those who are garbed and crowned with honour , those besmirched with infamy.

 It's nothing but circumstances between us. Their plot is such that there are those who are heralds, those who are heralded and those who are unheralded masses. Mere circumstances stretch and fill

 possibilities within the circumstantial spectrum.

 8>)

 Just Passing By :

 Questions and reality of mortality meet us head on. They are inescapable in this mortal sphere. With each experience we grow towards maturity and acceptance of the frailties of the flesh in Life's autumn. Mortality steps on our plate. It comes with mounting frequency. Rising generations. Receding elders. They meet , then one of them become recollection.

 8>)

 Workers Of The Land :

 Let's turn our plaudits from urbane beings to workers of the land. Ever so often overlooked in this age of metropolis. Their handiwork beget sustenance which we require to sustain life and maintain our well being. The country's produce douses bothers of hunger, satiates palates. Their bread and butter , our bread and butter.

 Workers of the land, at times contemned, dismissed as simpletons. Give them their due. Short change them not with regard. The earth had been generous to them when our tongues were miserly. Workers of the land, nurtured by the earth and they nurture the earth in return for its gifts.

 8>)

 Rest :

 Sleep is relief between exertions and effort we demand from ourselves. Much as we crave to eject all stops , the flesh craves due rest. The sword misses its scabbard. It returns to its housing when warlike vigilance is out of place. Take rest when your being needs its nourishment. Resume your affairs when refreshed. Thoughts dart. Senses sharpened. Limbs have their nimbleness returned. Go fly into the arena. Spend strength inside. When weariness gives the cue, come right back to the lull of repose.

 8>)

 Good Times :

 The time we had. Life's delights shared. Repartees. Jousting with and jocular bandying. They take stage and fill gaps during bouts of excruciating inactivity. Scene, scents and discerned details. Moments of climax. Instances at the apex of tension which left all ahanging on every second of charged anticipation relieved by laughter when the punch line was delivered. Unexpected turns, surprise when it caught us at the tender flank, we were stupefied. Then senses roused us to cheer the deftness of the deed.

 We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing. Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections, even years after the official publication date.

 Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.

 These Web sites include award-winning information about Project Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).

 Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement can get to them as follows, and just download by date. This is also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

 Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

 Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want, as it appears in our Newsletters.

 Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+ If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.

 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

 At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks. We need funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain or increase our production and reach our goals.

 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

 As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

 We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones that have responded.

 As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states. Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

 In answer to various questions we have received on this:

 We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have, just ask.

 While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to

 donate.

 International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about

 how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are ways.

 Donations by check or money order may be sent to:
