 HUMAN COMPANY

 A Novel by Robert Petty 

 CHAPTER 1

 -- MECHANICALS

 The trouble with women is that all you get is sympathy. They will probably still be patting me on the head when the Elevator destroys the world.

 As I searched for Redblood, I took a deep breath to ease the tightness gripping my chest. This would be her last chance. She either helped me or else.

 Was she gone? A dark shape moved on the left -- only a horse in the stables. Across the square, the open gate framed a deserted drawbridge. Why did it have to get dark so soon? At last I saw someone to the right, standing on the castle wall. Shadows from the tower hid her features, but she stood straighter than the farm girls. It was Redblood.

 She frowned, I thought, when she saw me on the ladder, and when she extended her hand to help me onto the walkway, she tilted her head to make my name a question. "Gypsy?"

 "It's cold."

 It wasn't, not really, but she let me snuggle against her while she stared up at the mechanicals' garage. Several times I started to speak, but what could I say when her thoughts were so clearly on tomorrow.

 So I watched the shadows chase the last rays of sunshine off the peaks and tried to marshal my arguments. I was too young, she would claim, but fifteen years -- no, thirty winters, that sounded older -- was almost grown. They would make me marry next year.

 Finally, after the white rock of the cliff below the garage faded into darkness, she broke the silence. "I'm worried about Apogee."

 "You should worry about the Elevator."

 "Have patience little one." Her hand stroked my hair. "Your time will come."

 I pulled away. "Just look at it. You can see that it curves."

 She turned. The motion took her eyes to the east, but she didn't bother to look up. "It's always been that way."

 "Not in ancient times. It was straight then."

 My eyes sought the vertical line. The darkness of the land hid its base, but higher up the setting sun caught the silver thread as it rose into the sky.

 Once, two elevators carried women to their orbiting starships. But the old Femdom was gone: destroyed when the Western Elevator fell. The Eastern Elevator was the last of their ancient wonders, and now it too was in trouble. Up where the stars poked pinholes in the darkening sky, I could see it curve gently to the south. It was falling.

 They would blame me. They said not, but they blamed my ancestors when the Western Elevator fell, and in the end, they would blame me too.

 "It's up to me to save it," I said. "I need your help."

 Redblood spread her hands. "You know that I'm committed to Apogee."

 "I told you. It's not about him."

 "I'm sorry."

 "But he always gets everything." I bit my lip. Law. I might as well have stamped my feet.

 "Good night Gypsy," she said, making the words a sigh that signaled the end of her patience. She had no time for kids. Not now.

 I watched her walk away. She paused for the briefest moment, but her glance was to the garage, not to me. Then she faded into the shadows.

 I would have thrown myself off the wall except my hand, acting on its own, crept into my pocket. So I let my fingers caress the cool, slick sides of the cards, as they always did, until they felt the cards warm to life. Then they traced quickly over the smooth edges to find the one card separated from the others.

 I drew it out. The Mech Card, omen of adventure. Sometimes the cards were like that: so right, yet you still had to think about what to do.

 The Mech Card. It had to be about tomorrow. I would have one last chance.

 #

 Smoky aromas from the breakfast fires still lingered in the air when the trumpeters blew their horns and the procession came out through the castle gates. Everyone, even the people from the fair, crowded into the narrow street to watch them pass. They got in the way and you couldn't see anything except the pennants dragging a bubble of applause and commotion through the village.

 I couldn't get to the front, but as the procession passed, I found a box to stand on. Even so, I still had to raise up on my toes to see over the women's heads. I could just make out Redblood leading the way with Apogee on her arm. Redblood's company flanked them: Stoneheart carried Apogee's pennant; Slayer, the Mechanic's pennant. Mechanic Axeblade, the Court, and important property owners trailed close behind.

 Redblood looked fierce. She wore full battle gear: a broadsword across her back, a short sword at her side, and numerous knives stuck in her belt and strapped to her legs. The black leather armor and polished breast cups clung to her figure and emphasized her strength.

 "Redblood. Redblood. Look at me," a little village boy called as she passed. Her answering wink brought a chorus of screams and whistles from the other boys. They kept it up, making her grin and breaking her pretense at a serious demeanor.

 Apogee remained somber. Dressed in the traditional heavy shirt and baggy trousers of a mech rider, he kept his eyes straight ahead and did not respond when called.

 Since ancient times, the flight ceremony has tested the boys from Farhaven. By mountain law, only boys who have flown can rule. So today Apogee would ride a mechanical and earn the right to commission a company. One day he would become the Rider; his captain, the Mechanic.

 The confusion and milling about helped me. No one noticed as I pressed through the excited crowd and attached myself to the procession. I was taking a chance: the women tried to keep boys out of the garage; too dangerous they said. And Axeblade had threatened dire punishment for the next time I got into trouble. But I had drawn the Mech Card. I had to go.

 #

 The long path to the garage wound back and forth up the face of the mountain. On the switchbacks, I could look up and see the black openings of the cave mouths where the mechanicals took off and landed. They liked the long drop down the sheer cliff because it allowed them to build up the speed needed to create lift from their wings.

 But the trip dragged on when you had to walk. I kept hoping we would finally be there, but it never seemed that the garage got any closer. Eventually the pull of the steep trail wore at my legs and as my excitement cooled, my mind drifted.

 Below I could see the village, grown tiny as we climbed. I spread my arms:

 #

 I was a mechanical soaring high above the land. I swooped down low and fast over the rooftops. The boys and old women ran around in panic, frightened by the fierce rush of my passing. Trying to chase me off, guards shot arrows into the air. But I laughed at such feeble efforts and used my speed to dodge the tiny shafts. Choosing a fat cow for my prey, I swept forward in a terrific dive, impaling it with my manipulators and dragging it into the air. With mighty beats of my wings, I surged upwards towards my garage.

 #

 The grasp of a powerful hand on my arm ended my triumph. It belonged to Mistress Tallebrand, a shop owner I could sometimes talk out of taffy or peppermint. "Careful Gypsy. You almost went over the edge."

 Her words made me look down. When I saw the depths below my feet, my head spun and I clung to her.

 "You shouldn't be here anyway," she continued as she dragged me to safety. "Maybe you should go back down to the village."

 "Apogee wants me here," I said. "He says he might need me." It wasn't really a lie: I was Apogee's adopted brother; he should have invited me.

 She looked dubious but couldn't think of another excuse to send me back. "All right," she said at last, "but stay out of the way. And no more play acting."

 I wiggled from her grasp and hurried to catch up with the procession. I had to be more careful. What would Redblood think if I got kicked out for acting like a kid?

 #

 At the garage, I followed the procession through a series of dimly lit tunnels until we stepped into the glare of light flooding a large cavern. Across the cavern, blue sky marked where it broke out of the cliff edge. To the left, more tunnels led back into the rock; to the right, a little alcove overlooked the ledge.

 While the crowd milled around in the center of the cavern floor, I stayed in the tunnel hoping to keep out of sight. Then, thinking that the alcove would be a better spot, I edged quietly around the cavern wall towards it. But when I got there, I saw that someone else had the same idea. A little girl hugged the shadows where she could watch without being seen.

 When she saw me, her eyes widened and she let her mouth fall open. The protruding teeth betrayed her: she was human. I started to summon a woman to chase her off, but then I remembered my own questionable status. So I had to risk her bad luck by throwing pebbles at her until she retreated down a dark tunnel.

 However, she was too dumb to realize that no one wanted to share her misfortunes. A few minutes later, I saw her across the cavern, peeking out from a small tunnel set well above the main floor.

 #

 Soon my nose wrinkled as oily fumes wafted into the cavern. It's the human girl, I thought, casting her baneful spell over us. But then a sudden silence drew my attention back to the cavern where a pale white mechanical crept onto the floor.

 They say the mechanicals are gentle and intelligent. Even though they couldn't speak, they once piloted ships between the stars. Still, the crowd backed away: the mechanical was the ghost of every insect you ever stepped on, come back to get you.

 First, it was big: the rectangular slab of its body was about the size and shape of a freight wagon. And it was unreal: gray shadows, moving under the white, translucent surface, hinted at mysterious forces. And like an insect, the legs seemed too thin and too long. Four straight shafts emerged from each side and angled upwards to tower over the body. At the top, the shafts formed a sharp 'V' before extending to footpads on the ground. The insect like appearance was heightened by manipulator arms extending from the front and by the two sensors setting on stalks rising from the top.

 Axeblade stood near the ledge with her arms raised. "Come, White Mech, Come," she commanded.

 A complex shuffle of legs glided the ghostly insect smoothly enough across the cavern; however as it neared my alcove, its mechanical nature was revealed. A trail of acid droppings sizzled on the ground behind it, and seeping oil created yellow stains around the leg joints.

 Axeblade made White Mech lower its torso to the cave floor, and when assistants brought steps forward, Redblood helped Apogee onto the mechanical's back. She laid him down on a cushion and strapped him securely in place. Afterwards someone pulled away the steps and the mechanical rose.

 Everything happened too fast. Expecting a speech from Axeblade, I sat on the ground to wait it out. But Axeblade simply raised her hand and White Mech stepped forward and disappeared over the edge.

 I didn't even get to see how the mechanical converted its legs into wings. By the time I inched over to the edge and looked down, white fabric was already billowing between them. They now formed the ribs of rectangular wings that extended from either side of the body. I did see the leg-ribs moving to tension the fabric and to adjust the shape of the wings until they caught the air.

 The mechanical soared out from the cliff face, and as it leveled off, it began beating the wings against the air to gain altitude. It rose quickly, and soon it was above us. When it reached a nearby peak, it wheeled about in a tight circle and immediately headed back, coming straight at us in a shallow dive.

 The landing was something. At the last moment, the mechanical spread its wings wide and braked sharply. With a loud crack, the fabric parted from the rear set of legs, and as they sprang down to the ground, the mechanical bounced and fell forward. Two more cracks, following in rapid succession, freed the other legs to catch the body before it hit the ground. The wing fabric -- it happened too fast to be sure -- seemed to get sucked into the legs.

 As the women swarmed to the mechanical, I realized the show was all over. The flight, the whole ceremony, had lasted less than five minutes. I didn't spit when Redblood took Apogee off, but I wanted to. What was he thinking? The women might never let him have another ride, and he hadn't done anything.

 He looked pale and seemed unsteady on his feet, but Redblood seemed not to notice. Instead of shaking his hand properly, she covered it with hers and bowed so low she was practically kissing it.

 "Rider," she called him.

 #

 I stayed in the alcove as the procession departed. The Mech Card had promised me adventure, but all I had gotten was to watch Redblood slobber over Apogee. That little human rodent was going to get it good for ruining my luck.

 Crouching down into the darkest shadows, I settled down to wait. Slowly the noise from the procession faded, and the cavern became quiet except for slight echoes and whispers coming from the bowels of the garage. I began to fidget with growing impatience: I couldn't wait all day for her.

 I resolved to leave, then changed my mind when my ears picked up a new sound. Never loud, a scraping and brushing got closer and closer until, finally, I saw her emerging from the tunnel where White Mech had come and gone. She was spreading sawdust on the oil and acid drops and sweeping them into a bucket.

 As she moved onto the launch pad, I stepped silently from the alcove, blocking her retreat to the tunnels. Intent on her work she did not immediately notice my presence, giving me time to take a good look at her.

 They say that the women who created the Femdom settled on Snowshoe because it was an isolated planet that no one else wanted. The isolation gave them the time and privacy they needed to remake themselves into bios, perfect women that were bigger and stronger and healthier than humans.

 And it does make sense that women who could tame a planet and build the elevators could remake themselves. But like their failed elevators, the remake must have been flawed: human births were becoming less rare.

 I could see why no one wanted to be human. She was dirty; of course - - old oil stained her clothes; grease smudged her cheek; and black grime hid under her fingernails -- about what you would expect from a mechanic. But the dirty yellow hair and crooked teeth made her look strange. And she was small: about my size and flat chested. Just a kid.

 When she turned back to the caverns, the unexpected sight of my feet startled her. She gasped and stood open mouthed while her eyes ran up and down my body.

 I gave her my meanest sneer. "So you like to spy on boys, do you?"

 "I meant no harm." Her voice squeaked.

 "I should thrash you good."

 She cringed a little then nodded hopefully towards the big tunnel. "I can show you the mechanicals."

 I snorted. The bribe was so flagrant. Who did she think I was anyway? Still... See the mechanicals? Was that what the card meant? Maybe I could ride one. Redblood would have to take me seriously then. She would have to help me save the Elevator.

 "I know all the mechanicals," she persisted. "Flasher is nice, you could meet Flash Mech."

 I put my fists on my hips and tapped my foot impatiently. "Well, all right. But I should report you."

 #

 "I know all about the mechanicals," she said as she led me down White Mech's tunnel. "They call me Tiny, I can show you everything, I never talked to a boy before."

 "The mechanicals call you Tiny?"

 "No, the women, mechanicals don't talk."

 We stepped out of the tunnel onto a ledge overlooking the garage. I squinted into the bright sunshine and saw an elaborate system of tunnels, ramps, and ledges covering the steep walls of an open crater. On the crater floor, tanks and vats surrounded the waters of a shallow lake. A confusing network of pipes interconnected the tanks, and from one vat, a torch flamed from a long tube rising into the air. Rainbow colors glinted off islands of oil film floating on the lake.

 Several mechanicals lay on the lakeshore with their wings spread out into the sun. A few others crept about their duties among the tanks. One mechanical swam in the water. Its legs spread straight out and rose and fell like oars as it propelled itself forward.

 Tiny tugged at my sleeve and I let her guide me down the ramp towards the lake. At the bottom, she released me and disappeared into an opening in the crater wall. I peered after her, and when my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I saw racks of legs, sensor balls, and other parts for the mechanicals.

 "I got batteries," she said when she came out. She had untucked her blouse and pulled the tails into a sack to carry something heavy.

 We walked out onto the crater floor past several mechanicals sunning themselves beside the water. They remained motionless as we passed, but I saw their sensor balls turning as they tracked us.

 "This is Flasher," Tiny said as we approached a brown mechanical.

 Clearly, the name came from the glow of light that slowly rippled under the brown surface of the mechanical. But despite the snappy name, the stir of internal lights, the gentle sway of wings in the breeze, and the slow rotation of sensors gave Flasher a lazy appearance.

 Tiny handed me a fist-sized ball. "Throw her a battery."

 I examined the dull red ball in my hand. The clay like material deformed when I squeezed it and came apart when I dug my fingers into it.

 I smoothed the battery back to its ball shape and looked at Flasher. Up close she looked too big to play with. A dozen feet seemed close enough, so I leaned over and threw the battery underhanded to her.

 She was lazy! Flasher's sensors barely moved as she casually opened a manipulator to capture the battery. She stuffed the ball into a hole in her body then resumed her posture of quiet watching.

 I picked another battery out of Tiny's shirt and pitched it well above Flasher's head. In a blur of sudden motion, wing fabric unsnapped; legs pushed the body upright; and a manipulator extended to snag the battery out of the air.

 After the battery disappeared into the hole, Flasher stayed up, looking alert and ready. So I threw the next battery as hard as I could, high and well away from her, out over the water.

 The throw was not fair, but Flasher sprang gamely backwards into the air, pushing with her powerful legs and spreading her wing fabric for balance. She did catch the battery, at the peak of her leap, but had no chance to right herself. She fell on her backside, and although Tiny and I ducked, we were soaked from the splash.

 As I took the last battery from Tiny, Flasher righted herself in the shallow water, getting her legs set underneath her, ready to spring in any direction. But instead of throwing the battery, I stepped to the edge of the lake, holding it out to her. Her sensors rotated suspiciously as she puzzled out the new rules of the game.

 When I remained still, Flasher crept forward, looming over me. I made myself hold my pose, resisting the urge to back away from her. Slowly her manipulator jaws closed over my hand and stripped the battery from my grasp.

 I moved between the two manipulators and touched Flasher's body. It was smooth and warm and gave just a little when I pushed hard. She was patient with me as I poked and prodded at one of her manipulators. For grasping, it had two powerful jaws that could rotate to any angle. And for finer tasks, the jaws could fold back to let tendrils get at the work. Her sensor stalks, I noticed, had bent forward so she could track my explorations.

 "Come on, let's take a ride around the lake," Tiny invited. She stepped on the joint where the first leg joined the body and scampered up onto Flasher's back. Then she held down her hand and helped me climb behind her. She slid up between the sensor stalks and had me sit behind her with my arms around her waist.

 "Swim, Flasher, Swim," she commanded.

 Flasher turned in the water and stroked gently away from the shore.

 "She understands you?" I asked.

 "Sure she does, I know all the commands, I'll show you, say, 'Left, Flasher, Left,' only loud so she can hear."

 It was fun -- learning to ride the mechanical. I liked the feel of the powerful legs pushing us across the lake, the feel of the noon sun drying the splash of cold water, and even the feel of my arms around the little human girl.

 #

 When we returned to our starting point I jumped off. "Come on," I said. "Let's take her to the ledge. I want to fly her."

 "Fly? It's too dangerous."

 "I thought you wanted to be friends."

 "You can meet all the mechanicals, we can have a swim in the lake."

 I raised my arms. "Come, Flasher, Come."

 Water cascaded down her sides as she heaved herself onto the bank and followed me towards the crater wall.

 "Wait," Tiny cried. "Wait, we've got to put on her harness."

 I lowered my arms to stop the mechanical. "All right," I said. "But make up your mind. If you want to be friends, you've got to help me when I want."

 I helped Tiny carry a cushion out from the storage cave. The leather straps coiled on its top made it heavy and awkward to handle, but with Tiny pulling and me pushing, we lifted it onto Flasher's back. Afterwards, Tiny made Flasher rise high on her legs so she could drop loose straps to me while I ran them under the mechanical's body and threw them back up.

 Once the harness was secure, Tiny pulled me up and we rode Flasher up the ramp. At the ledge, a tight knot formed in my stomach when Tiny made me lie down on the cushion. It positioned me up front between the sensor stalks, forcing me to look down past Flasher's body into the depths below the cliff edge.

 Fortunately, Tiny was quick. She used straps on the harness to tie my thighs in place and showed me a strap to grasp with my hands. "Hang on tight," she said. "And just let her go out and come right back."

 When Tiny scrambled off and raised her hand, Flasher stepped off the ledge and we plunged downwards. 

 CHAPTER 2

 -- FARMERS

 

 The trouble with jumping off cliffs is it makes you scream. But it wasn't my fault: the harness was too loose. For that first moment as we fell free and the wind tugged me away from Flasher's back, I had this vision of myself falling all alone down the cliff face, flailing my arms and legs all the way to the bottom.

 But the harness was sound: it just had a little slack was all. So I didn't fall; instead, Flasher's wings bit into the air, and I was pushed tight against the cushion. Then when we leveled off, I was released to the rush of the wind and the rhythm of her wings.

 We climbed towards the same mountain that Apogee had circled. Flasher wheeled around in the same tight circle, giving me a good view of the rocks and scrub brush that covered the peak. Then she started the shallow glide back to the garage.

 Not yet. Already my hands ached from gripping the strap, but we had work to do. "Up, Flasher, Up," I commanded.

 She surged upwards, taking me over the garage, over the crater with the lake. I could see the mechanicals lying around the water and looking up at us.

 We rose higher, soaring above the mountains until I could feel Flasher struggling with the altitude. I turned her back to the east and let her glide as I surveyed the land.

 I had been taught about Snowshoe, about how life clung to a narrow band of warmth around the equator of the planet, but now I could see it. When I looked left, I could see the approach of the Northern Winter, see the snowfield spread across the northern horizon as it made its annual invasion of the forest. When I looked ahead, I could see the forest, see it stretch eastwards across the badlands to the Rincon Mountains. And when I looked right, I could see the Sea of Storms, see the thin band of blue green color that now flowed free from the grip of the retreating Southern Winter.

 I looked below me. We crossed high over the garage and soared out over Haven Valley. A patchwork of yellow and brown marked where the women had cut their fields from the forest. As we lost altitude, the farmhouses and, eventually, the animals in their corrals became visible.

 When we wheeled around at the far side of the valley to head back towards the mountains, I spotted the caravan route, a thin brown line wandering from the sea towards Farhaven. We followed the route and dropped slowly towards the castle.

 I could see the fair. In the field between the castle and the village, a circle of tents formed an arena where the girls were competing. I made Flasher dive faster. We streaked between the castle and village, brushing the tops of the tents.

 I heard shouts. What did they say?

 A thump. Did we hit something?

 A hill loomed ahead. We soared up and over.

 Now Flasher had to work hard again, beating her wings against the air as she spiraled upwards towards the mountaintops. Once again she wheeled around the peak and began the glide into the garage. When the black cave mouth loomed before us, she spread her wings and flared to a landing on the ledge.

 "Are you okay?" Tiny asked as she untied me.

 "It was great." I slid off Flasher, then grabbed Tiny's arm. "Wow. The ground's moving."

 After I recovered my sense of balance, we led Flasher back to the crater, stripped off her harness, and sat on the bank while she cooled off in the lake.

 "I never had so much fun," I told Tiny. "We were so high I could see the sea. Did you see us at the castle? We were so low that I was looking up at the tower."

 #

 Axeblade's face flushed red. "You've gone too far this time," she said.

 My flight over the fair had caused a commotion. Frightened horses had bucked women from their backs, and cattle had stampeded out of the corrals and charged about the fairgrounds. Outraged, the mechanics had rushed up the mountain and marched us back down to the castle.

 "And you." Axeblade pointed an accusing finger at Tiny. "I trusted you."

 "She didn't do nothing," I said. "I made her help me."

 "Be quiet. You're fired Tiny. Get out of my sight."

 Poor Tiny. She kept her dignity, bowing to Axeblade and keeping her head up as she left the court. But I knew she was upset: she didn't say anything at all.

 I glared at Axeblade. "That wasn't fair."

 "I'll do the lecturing here," she said. "We have a responsibility to protect the mechanicals. Your actions... "

 I stared at the floor. When you argued with her or tried to explain, she went on forever.

 "Blame yourself for getting Tiny fired. If... "

 I discovered that if I turned my foot just so, my toes almost perfectly matched the outline of one of the floor stones.

 "I blame myself," she said at last. "I've been thinking of you as a child, but you've grown. It's plain you need to be courting."

 I looked up. "A warrior company?"

 Her lips turned up in a cynical smile. "I'm thinking a good steady company to keep you out of mischief."

 I folded my arms. "Not farmers."

 "Now Gypsy. Don't be stubborn. I want you to let Littlewolf take you to the fair. Be nice, give her a chance and perhaps we'll forget this morning's little adventure."

 "You'll give Tiny her job back?"

 "Well, perhaps. But you can't keep getting the girls into trouble."

 #

 When I left the court and looked about for Littlewolf, I spotted her long blonde hair and bronze skin across the courtyard. She was in the stables petting Axeblade's horses and talking with Yellowbird and Shortbull.

 I crossed the yard and slipped under the rail to join them. "Victory is my favorite," I said.

 "She's got the look of a workhorse," Littlewolf said. "I bet she could pull a straight furrow."

 I patted the gray mare's neck and rubbed my hand over her flank. "She'll not see a plow I hope. It's carrying warriors into battle she's bred for."

 "It's the same," Shortbull said. "My mom says that the best workhorses are the steadiest in a fight." Shortbull would be steady in a fight: her name perfectly suited her muscular build. Even her voice possessed a solid huskiness.

 "We've formed a company." Yellowbird's voice sang. Finely chiseled features made her exceptionally attractive, but she had fair skin and coal black hair, so it wasn't until she spoke that you understood her name.

 "So look at you," I said while tugging at Littlewolf's sleeve. All three girls were outfitted in matching leather vests with hardwood buttons. "Are you looking to do some courting perhaps?"

 "Did the Mechanic speak to you about us?"

 "I forget. Something about keeping you out of trouble."

 "Trouble?"

 "Come on," I said. "There's lots to see at the fair."

 #

 The fair was the event of the year. Everyone came: farmers to sell their produce; merchants to hawk their wares; and craftswomen to show their skills. And of course they offered treats to eat and prizes to win. But the real excitement was in the arena where the girls competed for their futures in the archery and wrestling.

 Girls liked stories about old Earth because, in these stories, there was always a boy for every girl. But I always laughed when I heard them. "Earth's a myth," I would say. "How could just one girl properly support a boy?"

 "Oh, would you rather belong to the fems?" the meaner girls would reply. Everyone knew that they kept us as pets.

 Never mind. After the collapse of the Western Elevator, came the Troubles, an age long struggle for survival. When the cloning technology was lost, boys became the only means of reproduction, so we were important now.

 But in tinkering with our genes, the fems had almost engineered us out of existence, so we were always too few. Wars were fought over us until the One Law led the farmers' army to victory.

 Looking back, one had to wonder why it took so long to work out. The One Law required girls to ban together into marriage companies. As company, they pooled their resources to attract a boy and fought together to defend their claim to him. What could be more natural than that?

 #

 We toured the exhibits. The girls were excited about picking out breeding stock from the prize animals at the fair. Shortbull was particularly impressed with the good selection of pigs. She quickly got into an argument with Littlewolf over the merits of the Landrace versus the Berkshire breeds. Then Yellowbird started in about how the Duroc breed was the most adaptable.

 "Let's go watch," I said when trumpets announced a competition.

 A crowd of cheering and jeering girls already surrounded the wrestling pit, but they gave way when I pushed on them. When I reached the front row, I saw Apogee rubbing oil onto Redblood's arms and legs. He was taking his time about it, rubbing it in like he was more interested in touching than helping. Slayer and Stoneheart walked around the pit, kicking the sand smooth and glaring at Redblood's opponent.

 No one expected Redblood's marriage to Apogee to go unchallenged. Someone needed to do it, but not Winifred, not Tallebrand's daughter. For despite Winifred's habit of hanging about the court and fawning over Apogee, she could not hide her merchant's heart. The mechanicals are an expense and of no real use, she claimed. They would not fare well with her as Mechanic. No one that loved them would cheer for her.

 The oil saved them. When the trumpets sounded, the girls stepped into the ring and right away Winifred feinted to the side and dived for Redblood's legs. She caught one and started to pull it out from under Redblood, but her hand slipped on the oily skin. Redblood pulled free and the girls began circling each other.

 The pattern repeated: several times they grappled and one girl or the other would gain an advantage only to lose it when her opponent pulled away. Both girls were quick, but Winifred lacked Redblood's endurance. As Winifred tired, Redblood began to catch her more often and her escapes became more desperate.

 It ended suddenly: Redblood got in close and flipped Winifred over her hip. Winifred lay in the sand where she fell until Redblood reached down to pull her to her feet. Only then did Redblood raise her arms into the air to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd. Then she walked away, surrounded by friends, one arm still in the air, the other around Apogee.

 I stared at the sand until the crowd thinned enough for Littlewolf to reach me, "What happened?" she asked.

 "Redblood won," I said. The mechanicals won. They needed Redblood and her mechanic's heart.

 I sighed. Well, I would just have to find another captain. But there ought to be rules. Especially when the world needed saving.

 #

 The farm girls bought sausages wrapped in white bread, and we took them to a sunny spot on the castle wall. While we ate, Littlewolf explained how the girl's families would provide a dowry that included the Bullhead Ranch, fertile land in the lower valley.

 "A ranch is fine," I said, "but I'm looking for girls to help me with the Elevator."

 "The Mechanic said we shouldn't encourage you," Littlewolf replied. "She says that the scholars at Towerhold will deal with it."

 "They're not gypsies. What do they know?"

 "Well, it's nothing to worry about anyway." She shrugged and popped the last of her sausage into her mouth.

 I nibbled at my sausage. That was the problem -- it seemed so harmless: a thin thread in the sky. Yet, I knew that the Western Elevator had destroyed the Femdom and plunged the world into the dark age called the Troubles. But how?

 I wished that I could speak to a real gypsy: someone who knew something.

 #

 "We should look at the horses."

 "Wait. There's Tiny," I said pointing through a break in the crowd.

 Littlewolf took hold of my arm and held me back. "A human?"

 "She's my friend." I pulled free and walked over to her.

 Tiny was full of news to share. She had found another human girl, a caravan guard. Bandits had attacked a caravan. They were taking on extra guards. Her friend had found her a job tending horses. She was going to Calmwater.

 "To the sea? When?" I asked.

 "Tomorrow."

 "You're lucky. I have to stay here and raise pigs."

 Littlewolf objected, "It's honest work."

 "But sometimes a boy needs excitement," said a new voice. It belonged to an olive-skinned girl with dark eyes who had been standing with Tiny.

 I looked her over for signs of being human, but she was too big, too perfect.

 Littlewolf stepped between the stranger and me. "He's with us." Yellowbird and Shortbull eased closer too.

 "Well, it is Fair Day." The stranger's smile flashed clean white teeth. "I'll fight you then. For an introduction. Archery or wrestling?"

 "Wrestling," Shortbull answered.

 The stranger was somewhat taller and slimmer than Shortbull, but when she stripped off her blouse and trousers, I could see that she gave nothing away in strength. She was slim only because she had no fat at all. Her bulging muscles stretched her skin so tight that you could see veins and tendons underneath.

 When the girls stepped onto the sand, someone sounded a trumpet and a crowd gathered around. Shortbull and the stranger wasted no time feinting and circling; they embraced and stayed locked together in a contest of raw strength. Except for the quivering of their muscles, you could have thought them statues carved from stone.

 We'll be here forever. The thought made me glance anxiously around. What could be more embarrassing than being the subject of a poor fight? The crowd, however, seemed content to wait it out. The girls fell silent and stared intently at the contestants, looking for the first sign of weakness.

 Suddenly the girls began screaming, and I looked back to see Shortbull starting to give way. Slowly, with relentless force, the stranger bent her over backwards. Several times she took strength from the cheers of her friends and struggled back nearly upright, but finally she could do no more and collapsed to the ground.

 Leaving Shortbull on the ground, the stranger waved briefly to acknowledge the applause of the crowd, then she bowed to me. "I am Amin, My Lord, trader in fine goods."

 "Don't call me Lord," I said as I offered her my hand. "I'm no farmer."

 "Gypsy then." She smiled, but her handshake seemed quick and light for such a strong woman. "Come. I'm thirsty. Let's have a beer."

 "Beer? I'm too young to drink."

 "Wasn't that you on the mechanical this morning?"

 "So?"

 "So by mountain law, you're grown." She offered me her arm. When I took it, she gestured to Tiny. "Fetch my clothes Tiny. You can come with us."

 "You caused quite a panic this morning," Amin said. "A bull broke out and chased everyone around."

 "Did it?" When I glanced back, I saw Littlewolf and the other girls watching us leave.

 #

 Amin sipped on her beer. It made my mouth pucker just to watch her. Women only drink it to prove they're women. They couldn't possibly like it.

 "It's wrong that I was able to take you from the girls like that," she said.

 "Wrong?"

 "We should be sharing the boys, not fighting over them."

 I sucked in my breath. Axeblade said bandits were saying things like that.

 I glanced around. We were in a quiet corner of the Mechanic's Inn; no one was near. Still, this was dangerous talk. "Hush. Someone might hear."

 "It's something that needs hearing."

 "Are you a bandit?" I asked.

 "Because I'm willing to discuss new ideas?"

 "It's not the One Law."

 She smiled. "So have the gypsies become defenders of the One Law then?"

 I frowned. Where were my loyalties?

 We had not always been gypsies, once we had been the caretakers of the elevators. Ferrying women and mechanicals into space had made us rich and powerful.

 Afterwards, when the survivors blamed and persecuted us for the collapse of the Western Elevator, we used ancient powers to build the fortress at Towerhold. Hiding behind the great walls, we became an isolated and secretive people with our own ways and laws.

 But after the farmers defeated the barbarian tribes in the war that ended the Troubles, they resolved that there would be no more wars. So they declared that all peoples of the land must follow the One Law. Fearful of the farmer's wrath, the sailors at Calmwater and the mechanics at Farhaven submitted. Only the caretakers, who thought ourselves safe behind our walls, resisted. But walls are not warriors: the farmers swarmed over them and took the city.

 Still, we refused to bow to the One Law. We abandoned the Elevator and threatened to bring it down on the farmers' heads. But this only angered the farmers, who cast us out of the city and banned us from owning property. We became gypsies then, wandering about, doing odd jobs, telling fortunes, and creating mischief until the farmers drove us out of the land entirely. So now we were sailors, living at sea beyond the reach of the farmers' army.

 No, the gypsies would not defend the One Law. But I was a gypsy by birth only: I had been raised by Axeblade after being rescued from a shipwreck. The One Law was what I had been taught; I had nothing gypsy except the cards.

 "It's still bandit talk," I said. "Axeblade says there will be fighting soon."

 Amin fell quiet, sipping on her beer and looking thoughtful, so to change the subject, I looked at Tiny. "Axeblade says you can have your job back."

 She shook her head. "Saratan says the sisters have a school in Calmwater, she says I should go."

 "Sisters?"

 "Human girls, we have to stick together."

 "Human girls," Amin said. "There's a case where the One Law is hardly fair. They're too small to compete."

 "There's more to it than the competitions," I objected. "The boys get to decide."

 "Oh? Was it your choice to be with farmers? I heard you were looking for warriors."

 "You got it wrong. I'm looking for help with the Elevator."

 "The Elevator? Don't you need a gypsy company then?"

 I shrugged. "Do you know one?"

 "Not personally," she said. "But their ships stop at Calmwater often enough."

 I noticed that her eyes were locked intently on mine. What was she getting at?

 "What good does that do me?" I asked.

 "You could come to Calmwater with us."

 I wanted to. The gypsies were a mystery: why weren't they already doing something? Surely, they knew the Elevator was falling. If I could just talk to them. We could raise a company.

 I sighed. "Axeblade wouldn't let me go."

 "So don't tell her," Amin said. 

 CHAPTER 3

 -- TRAVELERS

 

 The trouble with running away is they make you get up too early. I should have rested when I reached my hiding place, but nervous energy made my idle fingers select a card, and now I had to worry about it too.

 And I was distracted by cracking whips, snorting horses, and creaking harnesses -- sounds of heavily loaded wagons -- that broke the morning stillness. The noise grew louder as the caravan approached and soon teams of four, sometimes six, horses pulled wagon after wagon past my hiding place.

 The wagons groaned under the weight of furs and leather, cheese and grain, salted pork and beef. No great treasure, just mountain goods purchased at the fair for the markets on the coast. Yet hard looking guards walked alongside the wagons. These merchants meant to deliver their goods. Bandits beware, they declared.

 For a while, I watched them from behind the bushes, but the yellow rays from the morning sun hurt my eyes, so I leaned back against the tree and let my ears track the caravan's passage. My fingers flipped the card over and over. It was the Elevator, omen of death. Clearly it portended the coming journey. But what? An urgency to begin? Or a warning of doom?

 Not that it mattered. If anyone called me a fool for running off without a proper company -- well, they weren't helping me, were they? In Calmwater I could raise a company of gypsies to save the Elevator.

 A fading of sounds drew my attention back to the road. As we had agreed, Amin and Tiny walked behind the last wagon. They had already passed my hiding place in the woods, so I returned the card to my pocket, picked up my pack, and hurried up the road after them.

 "I knew you would come," Tiny said. She took my pack and trotted forward to find a place to stow it.

 "Any trouble?" Amin asked.

 "No. I did like you said."

 Better even. The previous night, I had caught Axeblade busy conducting business and mentioned that Littlewolf wanted to show me the ranch.

 "That's fine," Axeblade had said to get rid of me. A few days from now, when she summoned Littlewolf to explain, I would be long gone.

 "And here?" I asked.

 "All arranged."

 Meet the new me: Troy, farm boy and nephew of Amin who was taking me to Calmwater on family business.

 The tricky part was joining the caravan without being seen by anyone in the village. I was delayed, Amin had told the caravan mistress. Of course, the caravan couldn't wait, so we were to catch up.

 Now all we had to do was avoid attracting attention until we were well down the road.

 #

 Tiny and another human girl waited on the side of the road for us. "This is Saratan, she's going to teach me to be a warrior."

 I almost laughed. The girl's sword practically dragged on the ground. At three-quarters Amin's size, only a few inches taller than me, she looked like a kid playing with her mother's weapons. Except I didn't dare laugh: the heavy brows that framed her thick nose and lips gave her an angry look.

 She glanced down at my hand, but I kept it at my side. Did she expect privileges? Tiny, I bet, had been blabbing secrets.

 "Hello," I said.

 She nodded stiffly. "My Lord."

 "Don't call me -- Oh!" I looked at Amin and rubbed my bottom where she had pinched me.

 "Excuse me My Lord. It is necessary to be careful."

 I scowled at Saratan. Amin's pinch had been a needed reminder of our deception; still, I didn't like the way human girls always caused trouble. And I wondered how much she had been told. She was Tiny's friend but her main loyalty would be to the caravan. Or would it? Did women who fought for money have loyalties?

 "I was just admiring your bracelet," Saratan said. However, her grin turned the compliment into a rebuke. "Farm boys don't often wear gold."

 So she knew. I slipped the bracelet off and put it into my pocket. But she kept looking at me, so I removed the necklace and rings too. Finally she nodded her approval.

 I glared at Tiny. It was bad enough that she was tagging along. But now she had this other human girl hanging around giving me orders.

 "If you want to ride," Saratan said, "I can stop one of the wagons."

 "I'll walk." One thing I knew for sure: mercenaries expected to be paid for their services.

 #

 But walking was awkward. Over the years, wagon wheels had cut deep ruts into the road. Amin invariably walked in the center, along the hump between the ruts, so to stay close to her, I walked on the side of the road. I had to dodge bushes and rocks, but at least it forced Saratan and Tiny to walk behind us where I didn't have to talk to them. I did, however, have to listen to their chatter.

 "When will we get to the mountains?" Tiny asked.

 "Tonight perhaps," Saratan said. She explained that the caravan route ran generally southeast to the Sea of Storms. Past the farms of Haven Valley it climbed steeply over Gates Pass and then dropped slowly until it met the sea at Calmwater.

 "Will we get to see any ships?"

 "Lots, they come from everywhere to trade at the market."

 "Gypsy ships?" I bit my lip. The question had just popped out.

 "Sometimes," Saratan said. "You'll know they're gypsy because they're big and have three masts."

 "I know that."

 "Will you show us the market?" Tiny asked. "Can we take Gypsy?"

 "Troy," Saratan said. "Call him Troy or we'll be found out, don't forget."

 There she was, giving orders again. Let Tiny ask the questions.

 Three masts and big. Something to remember.

 #

 We trailed along behind the wagons throughout the morning, until in the mid-day, they came to a halt. The drivers began dismounting, stretching and walking over to the camp wagon to collect their lunch.

 Tiny and Saratan had horses to tend, so Amin escorted me to the camp wagon and introduced me to the caravan mistress. "This is Mistress Sayyid."

 I offered my hand.

 "My Lord. I feared we had missed you." Her hand was big and callused, what you would expect from a working woman. It swallowed mine as we shook.

 "Barely made it. It was a rush."

 She raised an eyebrow. Axeblade did that too, when she expected a real explanation.

 I grimaced and put my hands up in mock frustration. "Well, when Amin said sunup, how was I to know she meant the middle of the night?"

 Sayyid smiled with amused tolerance. I knew she would: women like being smarter than boys. She even took me to the head of the line for my meal.

 #

 The lunch stop was too brief. Tiny and Saratan, who had done chores, were still eating when Sayyid came around rousting the women back to the wagons. Worse, I had not recovered from the morning's walk: my legs felt stiff and weak when I rose.

 "Can I ride?" I asked.

 "Over there," Sayyid said pointing to her wagon.

 Saratan, who was eating with her knife, scraped the last of her beans from the plate into her mouth and started to rise. "I'll help you up."

 "I can do it." I didn't need help from a human. So maybe they let her carry a sword, but did she think I wouldn't notice that the real guards had already eaten?

 However, when I reached the freight wagon, I realized I had no idea how to get up. The wheels were about the same height as a tall woman, so the wagon body sat too high above the ground for me to pull myself up.

 Saratan leaned uninvited against the wagon and picked at her teeth with the stem of a weed. "Step on the spokes."

 "I know that."

 The spokes were sloped at awkward angles for climbing, but I managed to climb aboard by stepping first to a lower spoke, then to the hub, then to an upper spoke, which got me high enough to pull myself onto the top of the wheel and into the seat.

 Sayyid climbed aboard and put the reins in my hands, four big leather straps in each. Then she cracked her whip in the air and the horses leaned into their collars. The harness creaked and groaned from the strain then eased as the big wheels started turning.

 As we pulled away, Tiny joined Saratan and I lost sight of them behind the wagon. But Tiny, I noticed, had found a straw to chew on also. I would have to speak to her. She didn't need to be picking up bad habits from a mercenary.

 Sayyid kept me busy for a while, pulling on one set of reins then another and slapping them onto the horses' backs as we maneuvered onto the road. But once the caravan formed up and began moving, the horses were content to follow along behind the wagon in front. I needed only to leave slack in the reins and slap them occasionally when a horse got lazy about pulling its share of the load.

 "What takes you to Calmwater?" Sayyid asked.

 "Family business. A private matter."

 "An important one, I hope. This is a bad time for a boy to be traveling."

 "I have Amin. She is quite capable."

 "Of course. Still, traveling without a company... Seems unwise. I am reminded of a time when..."

 From the seat I could look down on the backs of the horses and see how they were harnessed. The tongue ran forward from the center of the wagon and supported a set of double hitches behind each pair of horses. From the hitches, straps ran forward and attached to collars around each horse's neck. Another set of straps, the reins, ran backward from each side of the horse's muzzles into my hands.

 "... so you see, it's never a good idea..."

 Axeblade and Sayyid could not have been related. But it was odd: the way they were the same. Oh, they meant well enough, I suppose, but if they had their way, I would never get out of the castle.

 #

 I whiled away the afternoon by watching the trees pass. As we climbed out of the flat lands, they began to show their fall colors, giving one a sense of the coming winter. But as we moved into the shadow of the mountains below Gates Pass, the forest changed. Dark green trees, the kind that didn't change color in the fall, crowded the road and spread heavy branches over us.

 Soon the foreboding trees stole the last of the light, forcing Sayyid to call a halt. When we pulled into a dimly lit clearing and climbed down from the wagons, the women began unhitching horses, spreading out sleeping rolls, and throwing wood onto campfires.

 I looked for Amin.

 She sat alone on a fallen tree near the forest edge. When I joined her, she held a silver coin towards me. "If I understand my legends, a gypsy boy will tell your fortune if you offer him silver."

 I looked towards the camp. We were quite alone, Tiny and Saratan seemed safely occupied with their chores, so I accepted the coin and rubbed it between my fingers. "What knowledge would you seek Mistress?"

 "Why, what the future holds of course."

 I took the cards from my pocket and let my fingers stroke their smooth surfaces. Other than a few dim memories, they were the only possession I retained from the shipwreck. They were made of some magic material that was impervious to abuse. Even after all these years, they showed no signs of wear; proof, I was sure, that they possessed powers from ancient times.

 Straddling the trunk to face Amin, I drew a card from the deck and placed it between us. "This is the Seeker Card," I explained.

 Laying the coin on the card I added, "The silver is used to connect you with the ancestors. If they like its feel, perhaps they will reveal something of what is to come."

 I drew four cards one by one from the deck, laying them face down around the Seeker. "Your question is quite general, so the ancestors cannot be specific. This spread is called Past, Present, and Future. The bottom card may foretell unexpected events."

 When I turned the cards face-up, one by one, they were:

 Past -- the Pulling, hard work with little reward;

 Present -- the Neglected Wagon, discouragement;

 Future -- the Beast, omen of danger;

 Unexpected -- the Elevator, omen of death.

 Again the Elevator had made its ominous appearance. It scared me until I looked up to see Saratan standing over us. As I had feared earlier: she had come over to see what we were doing, bringing her bad luck with her.

 The fortune was ruined, and I couldn't tell it: no good ever came of such grim tidings. I returned the coin to Amin. "The cards make no sense," I said.

 "Perhaps you could try again?"

 "Another time." I picked up the cards. "The ancestors are busy tonight."

 #

 We ate hot stew and black bread for supper, a perfect meal for an autumn night by the campfire. Afterwards one of the women leaned back and rubbed her belly. "Ah. Good meal Cookie."

 "Better with a warm beer," another said.

 "Make that a warm beer and a hot man."

 Sayyid stood and made calm-down motions with her hands. "Fems, we have a guest. Let us remember our manners."

 If only she knew. Sometimes when the women were drinking late at night, I would sneak into the court and listen to them tell raunchy stories. She would probably blush to think of some of the words I knew.

 Bowing towards me, Sayyid said, "My Lord. It is a tradition that when a boy travels with a caravan, that he should tell a story each night. Perhaps you will so honor us?"

 Again her words and manner reminded me of Axeblade. And I was reminded too of a game that I liked to play with the women. "Very well," I said. "I will tell you a story. But this story is also a puzzle. If you cannot find the answer before tomorrow night, then it is you women who must tell me a story."

 They all seemed interested and some were nodding, so I began:

 "A traveler was on the road when the weather turned bad. In the distance, she saw a farm, and seeking to find shelter, she headed for it.

 "Now the traveler knew that the farmers in that region were a suspicious lot. So when she came to the barn, she thought, 'Well I'll just stay the night in here and be gone in the morning before anyone knows.'

 "But when she opened the door, she found that the barn was full of bulls, the mean ones with long horns that like to stick you. So she closed the door and went up to the farmhouse.

 "The farmer was not happy to see the traveler. 'I already have guests,' she complained. 'The only space left is in my son's room.'

 "For a moment the traveler wondered how she could be so lucky. The son was one of those strong, lusty-looking farm boys the women like so much. You know the type.

 "But the farmer had other ideas. 'Don't much like the idea of strangers lurking about,' she said. 'But I want to be fair. Tell me something about yourself. If I judge it true, you can sleep in the barn. But if you lie, you'll be on your way.'

 "Of course this disappointed the traveler. Compared to the son's room, the barn and the road seemed equally miserable possibilities. But after scratching her head for a minute, she figured out what to say.

 "So the traveler spoke up and then it was the farmer's turn to scratch her head. She thought and thought and then had to let the traveler spend the night in her son's room.

 "Now the puzzle is this: What did the traveler say to the farmer? And remember: you must have the answer by tomorrow night, else you women will owe me a story."

 #

 In the morning I got up at first light. It had been a miserable night: the first night I had ever spent on the ground. Although I had cleared the ground of rocks and sticks before laying out my bedroll, they had somehow crept back under the blanket. Every time I would drop off to sleep, something would attack, poking me in the hips, shoulders, or sides. So despite being tired, I was too sore to lie in bed.

 The camp was quiet. Here in the shadow of the mountains, the early dawn light was still too dim to chase the women from their bedrolls. All except for Amin, whom I saw returning to the camp from the trail ahead.

 It seemed strange that she had been out in that direction because the river, where one might go to wash, was towards the rear of the camp. I meant to ask her about it, but not seeing me, she lay down and wrapped her blanket around her. I supposed she was trying to catch a few minutes more sleep before the camp rose and so I did not disturb her.

 The morning quiet did not last long. Soon the women were awake. The cook started breakfast and Tiny and Saratan began hitching the horses to the wagons. We were ready to move by the time the sun began shining into our eyes.

 As we climbed onto the wagons, Tiny walked by and asked. "Did the traveler tell the farmer she was a Justice?"

 "No. The answer is in the story."

 She would never get it, but I felt too tired to tease her. I climbed into the back of the wagon and stretched out on the grain where, despite the jolting from the road and the coarse cloth of the sacks, I soon fell asleep.

 #

 Tonight I'm sleeping in the wagon, I thought when I woke up. I stretched out on the grain sacks and yawned, feeling lazy and liking it.

 Mid or late morning, I guessed from the way the sun hung high in the sky over the mountains. In the front of the wagon, Sayyid seemed almost asleep at the reins. I saw Amin walking alongside, so I slid to the back of the wagon, climbed down the tailgate, and dropped to the road.

 Amin nodded.

 "Have we come far?" I asked.

 "A piece," she said.

 I twisted around and walked backwards so I could see where we had been. The road stretched straight behind us, creating an open lane in the trees. Through the slot, the sky looked like a blue arrow pointing down to the valley floor.

 "We're up pretty high," I said.

 Amin made no reply.

 I turned the right way about and walked along with her, but she kept her eyes busy scanning the road ahead and seemed hardly aware of my presence.

 Women. They're always moody. Or maybe she was just tired, I thought after a few more minutes. The warm day, the steady rise of the trail, and the relentless pace soon quickened my breath and brought a film of perspiration to my skin.

 I heard footsteps behind me and glanced around to see Tiny and Saratan walking forward to join us.

 "Are you awake?" Tiny asked.

 "Yes. But I should have stayed in the wagon." I exhaled loudly and hung out my tongue. "This trail is steep."

 Saratan snorted. "We're not even in the pass yet."

 "Great." I looked at the wagon, wondering if I could get back on.

 "That's the trouble," Saratan said.

 "What is?"

 "Saving the world, they make you work at it, a bother really."

 Go ahead and laugh, I thought. You aren't so tough. Amin could tear you apart.

 #

 When we entered Gates Pass, the mountains closed in on both sides of us. The road shared the canyon with a stream, which we could see running in a rugged little gorge below us. The drivers woke up from their sleepy ride and filled the air with the crack of their whips. The horses had their mouths open and they snorted and whinnied their complaints.

 I wanted to complain too, and take a rest. But I didn't dare, not with Saratan hanging about. It's stupid, I thought. Who cares what human girls think?

 Finally relief. When the canyon walls opened up and we came out onto a flat meadow, Sayyid called a halt for lunch and the women climbed down from their wagons.

 I rested on a rock. The meadow lay quietly in a little bowl in the mountains. Stands of white barked trees lined the edges of the bowl, hiding the harsh rock walls from our gaze. Splashes of red and violet wild flowers followed the stream where it cut across the straw colored grasses.

 Perhaps the meadow inspired a sense of tranquility, or perhaps the quiet merely provided some needed relief from the groaning wagons and cracking whips, but even the women gathering around the camp wagon spoke softly here.

 When I saw Tiny carrying buckets, I followed her down the stream bank to the water. I knelt down on soft moss and began splashing my face and neck, enjoying the shock of cold water.

 Upstream, I could see Sayyid and Amin. Something was wrong.

 Stop it, I wanted to tell them, this was not a place for arguing. I couldn't hear their words, but they were shouting and waving their arms at each other.

 Sayyid dismissed Amin with an impatient chop of her hand and turned back to the wagons. But she took only a couple of steps before Amin drew her sword and swung it at Sayyid's head. Perhaps warned by the sound of the sword being drawn, Sayyid managed to turn and throw up her arm for protection. However, the blow of the sword severed her arm and knocked her to the ground. Two more brutal slashes left the mistress motionless.

 Then Amin looked up and saw me staring at her. 

 CHAPTER 4

 -- BANDITS

 

 The trouble with ambushes is that no one tells you what's going on. Women, screaming women, rushed from the woods. They held their swords and pikes straight out before them and charged the wagons.

 Bandits! That's what Amin had been doing in the night: arranging an ambush. And Sayyid's murder was the signal to attack.

 I grabbed Tiny's blouse and dragged her into the stream with me. New, more terrible, screams from the wagons chased us across the water. We scrambled up the far bank and broke through bushes onto the flat meadowland.

 We clung to each other and looked desperately about. What to do?

 Hide? Maybe, the stream and the bushes shielded us from the carnage and maybe from bandit eyes.

 No. Upstream, I could see Amin struggling up the bank onto our side of the stream.

 Tiny saw her too. "Come on," she said as she pulled me towards Amin.

 "No." I shouted. "She's a bandit." Either Tiny hadn't seen Amin kill Sayyid or she was a bandit too. I had no time to sort it out. I jerked away from Tiny's grasp and sprinted across the meadow towards the woods.

 Tiny's footsteps pounded into the ground behind me. And over my shoulder I saw Amin break free from the bushes and begin running parallel to us, angling to enter the woods upstream of us.

 I looked ahead. The little band of trees between the meadow and the mountain was too narrow: we could never slip past Amin to escape upstream. Behind the trees, the mountain rose steeply upwards. And downstream, the canyon narrowed into the deep gorge.

 Again I felt Tiny tugging on my shirt. "This way," she said, trying to pull me downstream.

 "No. It's a trap."

 In the woods, I dodged around trees and cried out as the brush ripped at my legs.

 We burst through the shallow stand of trees to the canyon wall, a jumbled fall of boulders. I leapt up onto one rock and used it to spring to another, then another.

 A ledge blocked our way. I jumped up and just caught the lip. Tiny pushed on my bottom to help me up, then I pulled her after me.

 Below, Amin emerged from the trees and started climbing the boulders.

 We struggled up a steep slope. I grabbed a rock; it came loose and I slipped backwards. Tiny grabbed my shirt and held me up.

 Amin cleared the ledge and climbed relentlessly upwards after us. Didn't she ever slip?

 I could hardly breathe. "She's... gaining... "

 "Keep moving... Saratan is coming."

 I risked another glance backwards and paid for it with skinned knees from another slip. Saratan? Or another bandit? I couldn't tell. And what could Saratan do anyway?

 Tiny gave me no chance to look again. She kept pulling and dragging me upwards. Finally we reached the top and came out onto a broad ridgeline. We staggered up the ridge until a wall of rock blocked our path.

 We started to move to the right but Amin had caught us. She stopped ten feet from us. Everyone gasped for breath, unable to speak. I dropped to my knees and stared at her. Her hand worked the grip on her sword, turning it repeatedly in time with the heaving of her chest. I could see the blood stains on the blade.

 "Now Gypsy," she said finally, "there is no need to be running. I told you I would take good care of you."

 "You had best look to yourself first."

 Our heads jerked around. Saratan had finally caught up, just as Tiny had promised.

 Saratan and Amin glared at each other with grim determination, and as they approached each other, they crouched low in a fighting stance with their swords held out. Suddenly they charged at each other, clashing their swords together until Amin pushed the lighter Saratan backwards. Saratan stumbled and fell. Amin raised her sword.

 "No," I screamed as I picked up a rock and threw it at Amin.

 Amin ducked, giving Saratan an instant to roll to her feet. Another rock, from Tiny, struck Amin's shoulder and she gave ground as we pelted her with more stones. Saratan ducked under the stones and drove her sword into Amin's side.

 Everything stopped. Amin dropped her sword and sat down causing Saratan's sword to pull free. She held her hands to the wound and sat looking as if she couldn't believe the blood oozing through her fingers.

 After a while she looked up at me. "I meant to make you free," she said.

 "You murdered Sayyid."

 She shook her head. "It's war. I had to do it."

 She lay back then and closed her eyes. Her breathing quickened and her face paled and beaded with sweat. It must have hurt.

 #

 "We need to get going," Saratan said.

 I nodded.

 Saratan had allowed me to sit leaning against the rocks until I had recovered. Now she slid her hand under my arm and pulled me to my feet.

 "The caravan?" I asked.

 "Gone."

 As Saratan led us away from the bandits, I looked back to where Amin was lying. When you dreamed of adventure, only the bad women died. But on the road, you didn't even know who they were. Why did they make it so hard?

 Saratan followed the rock wall across the ridgeline until the ground started falling away into another narrow valley. There she paused and pointed to the west. "If we go down that way," she said, "we can work our way back to the trail and return to Farhaven."

 In the distance, the peaceful fields of Haven Valley lay under her outstretched hand, but my eyes turned to the eastern sky. The Elevator was invisible during the day, but its threat overshadowed the promised security of the valley. Already it had extracted a toll of blood. There could be no going home now, not until the Elevator was saved.

 "No," I said. "I'm not quitting."

 Saratan was surprised, I think. Or maybe she just thought I was stupid. She stared hard at me, but I met her eyes, and eventually she pointed to the east. "If we stay high and work our way around the mountain, we can cross the divide and cut the trail leading to Calmwater."

 I looked from Saratan to Tiny. Not the sort of girls to save the world, but they had rescued me from the bandits. Maybe they could take me to Calmwater. I nodded. Nothing had changed really: I could still raise a gypsy company; that was still the plan.

 I pushed past Saratan and started around the mountain. But I couldn't help looking back one more time. Amin was dead. I had seen her die. But I had this feeling, like she was watching me leave.

 Fields of jagged rock covered the mountainside. Most times we stepped from rock to rock, but sometimes when the gaps were wide, we climbed over or around them. Too often we slipped and hurt ourselves.

 Our struggle across the mountainside ate up the afternoon: the sun sat low in the west by the time we reached the divide.

 "Look," Tiny said. She pointed down.

 We stood at the top of a sheer cliff. Thirty feet below, the forest made a brown and orange blanket that gradually turned green as it flowed down over the hills to seek the warmth of the sea. Far to the southeast, the last rays of the sun glinted off the water.

 The evening light caught the Elevator too. I traced it into the sky, then blinked with confusion. It curved to the north, but that was wrong. That night with Redblood, it had curved to the south. I was sure of it. What was going on?

 "Come on," Saratan said. She showed us a crack in the cliff where some force of nature had found a fault in the rock and split it open, leaving us a series of ledges to climb down.

 "I can't do it," I said. "I'm too tired. I can't even see straight."

 "We can't stay here," Saratan said. She swung her arms around indicating the barren rock that covered the ridge. No trees, or even weeds, had ever rooted there to offer shelter from the wind and cold.

 "Come on," Tiny said. "We can rest when we get down."

 But she was wrong. When we reached the base of the trees Saratan set us to work scooping up dry leaves into a big pile. We just beat the darkness, and the terrible chill that descended with it.

 "Gypsies have powers," I warned as we lay down in the leaves. "Molest me and you'll be sorry."

 But I might as well have been talking to the wind. They turned me on my side and pressed against me and scooped leaves over us until we were buried. I would have protested, but my arm ended up around Saratan's waist, and I could feel the swell of something soft against my thumb. It was her breast I think, but I didn't dare move to find out.

 "What did she say?" Tiny asked.

 "Who?"

 "The traveler, what did she say to the farmer?"

 I groaned. "She said, 'Go to sleep.'"

 Saratan never said what she was thinking. Did she feel the touch of my thumb? Did she care?

 Soon the leaves and the press of bodies brought warmth and sleep.

 #

 We could see our breath in the morning cold. But no one thought of lazing about in the leaves. Hunger and thirst drove us out of our cozy nest.

 Thirst we satisfied at a stream. But hunger we had to endure, an endurance made harder whenever we passed bushes full of yellow berries. They say that people once lived on planets where the food was good. But no one on Snowshoe ever ate native food twice: only grown food was safe.

 We followed the slopes downhill, and whenever we had a choice, we worked our way east. Saratan said that if we could get back onto the road we could find a farm and get something to eat.

 But we found the farm first. We stepped from the trees onto a plowed field and there it was. In the distance, a white house sat on a little rise overlooking outbuildings and stone fences.

 "Hey," Tiny said. "Maybe you should tell us what the traveler said?"

 I laughed. "So you like farm boys?"

 "What if the farmer isn't friendly?"

 "Then tell her, 'You will send me away.'"

 She screwed up her face. "That makes no sense."

 "Think about it. What happens if the farmer decides your words are false?"

 "She sends me away."

 "So that makes it true. And she can't send you away, can she?"

 "So she puts me with the bulls?"

 "But if she did that, it would make your words false and she would have to send you away, which would make them true, so -- "

 "Come on," Saratan said. "Maybe this farmer will be friendly."

 #

 "Well we can't have humans lurking about," the farmer said. "Our husband won't like it. But see that woodpile over there? Go and split some logs and I'll bring you some lunch. Then you'll be on your way."

 Most of the wood was already split, neatly stacked and ready for the winter fireplace. But the farmer had left some logs for us. Most were two feet or so in diameter, and they had been cut into two-foot sections.

 "Farmers," I said. I could hardly lift the iron mallet. But I picked it up and dropped it onto the spike. The spike sank into the wood, and after more drops -- my efforts were too feeble to be called blows -- the log began to groan and finally gave out a crack as it split into two pieces.

 The farmer joined us at the woodpile bringing the aroma of fresh-made bread with her. It was on a tray with cheese and slices of beef.

 "I'll give you some advice." The farmer was looking at me. "You had better learn to work as hard as your friends here if you want to amount to anything." Her arm swept over the woodpiles. Saratan had quartered four logs and Tiny two while I had been struggling to halve the one log.

 But she left the tray and we sat on unsplit logs and tore into the food. The beef, which had been preserved in salt, left us thirsty so Tiny and I pulled a bucket of water up from the well while Saratan returned the tray to the farmhouse. She also got directions and we started down the road to Calmwater.

 "Do I really look that bad?" I said as I combed my hair with my fingers and brushed at the dirt on my clothes. The farmer hadn't even realized that I was a boy.

 #

 Two days later I was even dirtier. The farmers along the way had been friendly enough. They fed us and let us sleep in their barns. Of course, if they always made us do a chore or two, it was only to be expected. Farmers, I knew, held that everything should be earned. And it seemed easier to do the chores than to explain how a boy came to be running about with human girls. But I needed a bath and clean clothes and a sit-down meal.

 But despite the grime, my spirits lifted when we reached the outskirts of Calmwater. It's a festival, I thought. The fields outside the city were covered with tents, and colorful pennants flew everywhere.

 But it was not a festival. When we stopped at the first tent to ask what was going on, the women told us the army was assembling. They were going to fight Mercid the Mad.

 Mercid was called 'the Mad' because she advocated a new regime where men would be shared equally by all women. But this idea was contrary to the One Law. Women won men by forming companies: successful companies attracted men; unsuccessful companies did not.

 Most women who failed to join a successful company accepted their fate, but others had weaker souls. These unhappy women became easy prey for Mercid. She promised them men and land and recruited them into her bandit army.

 All summer long, while memories of dreadful famines kept the farmers in the fields, Mercid had grown stronger and bolder. The women that attacked our caravan must have been hers, and Amin must have been her agent.

 But now the harvest was done and the farmers were out to put a stop to her nonsense. Just as Axeblade had said, the war was starting.

 #

 Inside the city the market overflowed with warriors looking for something to do and vendors looking to help them find it. Their calls drew my eyes to the booths and carts, but Saratan hurried by, leading Tiny and me through the market into a narrow street.

 Soon laughter from an open tavern door drowned the unruly buzz of the market and then itself gave way to the sharp pounding of a smithy's hammer. But as the street turned past a tailor's shop, the city sounds faded until we could hear the slap of our footsteps on the paving stones.

 We entered a shop marked with a carved quill hanging over the door. Inside, desks and shelves crowded together, their surfaces overflowing with stacks of paper, boxes of quills, bottles of ink -- everything a scholar could need. A human woman labored over a vat, making even more paper, and in the back a girl sat at a desk, scratching at a paper with her quill.

 "Saratan!" The woman rose with open arms.

 While they hugged and patted each other, I swept disapproving eyes over the shop. Humans, it was plain, had no respect for tradition. Scholarship was for boys, but here they were, stealing our work. Worse, they were obviously not even competent. The cluttered shelves and dusty air made my lips pucker with distaste.

 "Mother, I want you to meet someone," Saratan said. "This is Gypsy."

 "You are Saratan's mother?" I asked. How could she have children? The wrinkles that deformed her face and hands marked her too clearly as human.

 "Some of the girls honor me with that title," Mother explained. "I help with their raising when I can."

 As her eyes dropped to take in my grimy appearance, it took an effort of will to keep from tugging at the wrinkles and tears in my clothes. And I shouldn't have been rude, after all Saratan, and hence her mother, had earned some respect, but my hands twitched and slid of their own accord behind my back.

 My manner must have betrayed me. Mother straightened and looked at Saratan. "A boy?" she asked.

 "A boy?" The girl, the one who had been writing, peeked from behind Mother and stared at me.

 Mother slipped her arm around the girl and drew her forward. "This is my apprentice, Scribbles."

 Scribbles and I looked at each other in mutual disdain. It would be better, I decided, not to look at her when eating. Her face was covered with pockmarks, and on the side of her nose, white puss looked ready to erupt from an angry looking bump. But what I especially didn't like was the way she pushed her head forward to look at me. "He's dirty," she pronounced.

 Saratan cleared her throat and drew Tiny forward, "This is Tiny, she's a mechanic."

 "Welcome to Calmwater Tiny," Mother responded. "Gypsy will be needing a bath, perhaps you and Scribbles can help him while I have a word with Saratan."

 #

 Scribbles led Tiny and me through curtains into a kitchen that extended behind the shop. The girls threw fresh wood into the fireplace and after filling an iron pot with buckets of water, swung it over the fire.

 "Is Mother sick?" I asked Scribbles.

 "Sick? Why?"

 "Well the wrinkles. And the white hair."

 "Huh? That's not sick, she's just old."

 She wasn't making sense. "Axeblade's old," I said, "and she doesn't have wrinkles."

 "Axeblade!" Scribbles almost shouted. "You're the gypsy! The one they kidnapped and sold to old Axeblade, there will be trouble over this for sure."

 "Trouble? What do you mean? No one kidnapped me."

 "I heard rumors, the Harbor Mistress helps gypsy crews jump ship, she'd never give a boy to them."

 Could it be true? The farmers -- they had never treated us fair. Sudden anger set me to pacing around the room. "Well, they won't get away with it. I'll find the gypsies tomorrow."

 "They're not real gypsies, you know."

 I glared at Scribbles. "Now what?"

 "They're not from old Earth."

 She was ridiculous. "Earth's a myth."

 "No, I've read books, an encyclopedia, written there."

 I shook my head and sat down to watch the fire. Kidnappings and rescues, gypsies and old Earth -- Scribble's theories flickered about faster than the flames. How human.

 #

 "It's ready," Tiny said.

 I looked blankly up at her.

 "The bath." She pointed to a tub, which somehow had gotten placed in the center of the kitchen floor and filled with water.

 When she followed Scribbles out of the kitchen, I stripped off my clothes and slid into the water. It burned my skin, but I slid all the way under, and when I surfaced, I immediately began soaping my hair. Farm dirt -- I wanted it gone.

 While I was rinsing my hair, Scribbles came back and announced, "I've got clean clothes and a towel."

 She approached right next to the tub making me double up to cover myself. Setting the fresh clothes on a sideboard, she reached down to scoop up my dirty clothes from the floor. "Hey, what's this?" she asked as she took my cards from a pocket.

 Already vexed at her for violating my privacy, I snapped, "They're mine. Put them down and get out."

 "Are they real?" She lifted the cards close to her eyes and started going through the deck, looking briefly at the design on each card.

 "Stop it," I pleaded. "It ruins the cards to have strangers handle them."

 Apparently the agitation in my voice finally got through to her. "Oh, all right," she said as she dropped the cards onto the clean clothes. "They're not real anyway."

 Humans. They're as bad as farmers. Law, they were farmers. Well, tomorrow I would find a real company, gypsies to help me save the Elevator. 

 CHAPTER 5

 -- GYPSIES

 

 The trouble with recruiting gypsies is that you have to find them first. I felt lost on the docks. In my memories, ships were things of motion: pitching decks, singing ropes, and canvas straining against the wind. These ships were idle. Their masts, spars, and rigging made a barren forest riding quietly above the fat tubs of the hulls.

 Looking out over the bay, I could see how the city took its name. Everything was calm here. A few birds wheeled in lazy circles and glassy smooth water reflected images of clouds drifting across the bay.

 But the same still air that left the harbor waters free of ripples also failed to carry away the smell of fish and bilge water. The unpleasant odors added to the churning in my stomach. It wasn't my fault. The human girls knew I was here to meet the gypsies, but they had forced me to be firm about coming alone. So by the time I left, everyone was upset.

 I was glad when the stillness gave way to the workday. The rising sun brought out the sailors and dockworkers. Soon they were shouting orders, swarming over piles of cargo, and running about on their errands. Many of them cast curious glances as I passed, but they let me be.

 #

 I knew the ship was gypsy when I saw it. For one thing it was big, the only three-masted ship in the harbor. Another thing was the familiar figurehead on the bow. I searched through my cards until I found it, the Mech Card.

 "A remarkable similarity."

 The unexpected voice made me start. When my head snapped around, I saw a tall swarthy woman standing next to me. She wore a loose fitting blouse and covered her head with a red bandanna. And big loops of gold stuck through her ears so that they dangled from the lobes.

 "Pardon me," she said. "I couldn't help notice your cards. An excellent copy."

 "It's no copy," I said. "The cards are real."

 She smiled. "Sometimes, I fear, the women misrepresent the copies they sell. But real cards are rare. And no gypsy would ever sell them."

 "You're right. I would never sell them." I returned the cards to my pocket. "And who are you to be telling me about gypsies?"

 Her smile widened at my challenge. "I am Captain Roma and this is my ship, the Sea Garage."

 "I've been in a real garage," I said. "And flown a mechanical. They call me Gypsy."

 Her face darkened. "Show me the cards," she commanded.

 I stepped backwards away from her and my hand gripped protectively over the cards.

 At the same time, Roma took a long look at me. She couldn't have seen anything special, just a boy in borrowed clothes, but as her eyes searched down to my feet and back up again, her intensity changed into a more studied look. "We should talk, I think. Can I offer you coffee?"

 I hesitated. What was that all about? A moment of -- what? And now she was acting casual.

 Finally I nodded. Troubles on the road had made me too suspicious: gypsies wouldn't be acting like farmers.

 #

 Officers, wearing the red bandannas, white blouses, and bright multi- colored trousers, supervised teams of gray women working hoists set in the rigging. One crew attached ropes to the barrels, boxes, sacks, and baskets on the dock; another pulled on the ropes to hoist the loads into the hold; another, I supposed, worked below to stow the goods.

 I thought the women gray, not so much because they wore sleeveless sacks of unbleached fabric, but because of their subdued manner. Other women I had known, mechanics and farmers and even the wagoneers, eased hard labor with friendly banner or chants. These women worked silently and watched their officers with more care than their cargo.

 Their need for caution became apparent when one woman paused in her task of coiling a rope to watch me walk up the gangplank. The lapse earned her a cuff on the head and a sharp reprimand from her officer.

 That officer and another came forward when we reached the deck. "My officers," Roma said. "Mate and Bosun."

 I nodded but didn't offer them my hand. "And the others?"

 "Petty officers," Roma said with a gesture towards the other commanders as if that explained everything.

 But it didn't. Sometimes, in the contests, girls got angry and struck each other. And in war they had to do it. But striking a woman for a pause at work?

 "And the gray women?" I persisted.

 "Gray women?"

 "The ones you beat."

 Finally, she sensed my disapproval. "You judge without understanding. We are not farmers with all year to debate decisions. At sea, disaster comes quickly; commands must be obeyed."

 I looked away. On the main deck where we had come aboard, open hatches, stacks of cargo, and work crews consumed every foot of deck space. Such a tiny world would need special rules.

 Still, as I followed Roma, I couldn't help notice the fortified nature of the aft quarters. A solid bulkhead that lacked windows and doors separated the quarters from the main deck. And a single ladder, guarded by two alert officers, led up to the aft deck. Were the officers afraid of their crew?

 #

 The jingling of rhythmic music spilled down from the aft deck as I climbed the ladder. At the top, I saw two boys shaking and tapping hoop shaped instruments. Another sat clapping in time while they laughed and offered advice to a boy trying to dance to their rhythm.

 Roma walked past the boys to a covered stairway that led down into the ship, but I stopped to look them over. They wore baggy green trousers and sleeveless maroon vests that were open exposing their chests and stomachs. They all wore several necklaces and a multitude of bracelets around each wrist.

 When they noticed my presence, their music trailed away and I could feel their eyes going over my clothes. One boy asked, "What's a farmer doing here?"

 "Well, he doesn't belong," another declared.

 Another challenged, "Who are you?"

 "Gypsy."

 My reply seemed to startle the boys, but Roma allowed me no time to talk with them. She took my arm and led me down the steps.

 #

 "I've heard all this before," I said.

 I had refused to show Roma the cards, but she was beyond needing proof. In her mind the mere possibility of the farmers committing an injustice made it true. But where Scribbles had seen a lowly kidnapping, she saw a grand conspiracy against the gypsies.

 "You should take this seriously," she said. "Young Daemon was aboard the Sea Beast when she went down. You are most certainly heir to the Tower Throne."

 I laughed. "You're crazy. No one ever called me Daemon. I would remember that."

 "No." Her scowl turned to a smug smile. "You would have been called by your title, not your name."

 "Title?"

 "Gypsy. It's a title, not a name. Only the heir to the throne is called that way."

 I frowned. She was as bad as Scribbles. I hated it when girls kept making stuff up to keep from admitting they were wrong.

 "It's too farfetched," I said. "And anyway it's an empty honor. The farmers have the throne now."

 Her smug look became intense. "Not for long."

 "What do you mean?"

 "We mean to take it back."

 She really was crazy. Hadn't she seen the army outside the gates? "They'll kick your butts," I declared.

 "They won't be doing anything after the Elevator falls."

 #

 So the gypsies knew the Elevator was in trouble. But the way she brought it up scared me.

 "You want it to fall?" I asked.

 "Yes."

 "But we're the caretakers," I argued.

 "No." She brushed the thought away with her hand. "We were dismissed from its care."

 I could hardly breathe. I had left my home, got women killed, deserted my human friends, all because I assumed a sense of duty that didn't exist.

 I had to make her help me. "But a collapse would destroy the land."

 Her voice remained harsh. "No business of ours."

 "But it is," I reasoned, "when the Western Elevator collapsed, it destroyed all of civilization. Surely the new lands would suffer as well."

 "Across the sea? No. And our ships will ride out the shock waves at sea. Then we'll land and take back what is ours."

 I slumped in my seat. How could she be so full of hate over something that happened so long ago? She didn't even have her facts straight. The gypsies had not been dismissed from the Elevator: they had abandoned it to spite the farmers.

 What was I going to do? My whole plan had been to enlist the gypsies' aid. But she would never help me -- that much was plain.

 The one thing I did know was that I couldn't quit. I had to save the Elevator before she disgraced us forever. I rose to my feet. "I had better be going now."

 She remained sitting.

 "It would be best for you to remain on board until we sail," she said.

 #

 I was a prisoner.

 Not so. She was trying to protect me. The farmers would do terrible things to me if she let me go. She had a duty to return me to my family. I would be wealthy and important.

 She was a liar. And worse, a no account pirate. All she wanted was profit. Or pleasure. And if she let the Elevator fall she would be worse that a pirate: she would be a murderer.

 As I ranted, Captain Roma's frown deepened until she rose abruptly to her feet. "We'll talk later," she said and stomped out of the cabin.

 When he cabin door banged shut behind her, I leaped towards the only other door in the cabin. But it was just a closet, the captain's private jake.

 Returning to the cabin door, I listened, and when I heard nothing, I tried it. It was locked of course.

 The cabin windows, I discovered, would open, but only a few inches. Enough to let fresh air in, but not enough for me to slip out.

 #

 All through the day the ship settled deeper into the water as load after load of cargo was brought aboard. The shouts of the crew and the creaking of the hoists continued into the evening hours with not even a break for lunch or dinner. Plainly the Captain was rushing the loading, intent on putting to sea this very night.

 At sunset I looked out the cabin windows and saw women swarm up the rigging of another ship. The sails rippled in the breeze as they were unfurled and the ship drifted away from the dock. One by one the sails billowed out and she heeled over and began racing across the water. She tacked just once as she cleared the breakwater and slid out of sight behind the point.

 Would the human girls realize that I had been kidnapped? Probably not. I had made it plain that I didn't expect to be back. And even if they got curious and came to see the Gypsy ship and somehow became suspicious, what could they do? Saratan could not fight the entire crew.

 I would have to get away on my own. And soon. Once we were at sea, I would have no chance to escape.

 Fortunately for me the loading continued after sunset giving me hope that I could make a break while the crew was tired and distracted with the loading. But during that long hour between sunset and darkness I paced nervously about the cabin.

 I kept searching to the east until the setting sun lit the silver thread. Up high in space, it curved to the south again. It was wobbling about, getting ready to come down.

 Time was running out.

 #

 When I entered the Captain's private jake, I could hear the waves, lapping at the ship's side under the wooden seat. The hole was too small for me to slip through, but when I yanked on the boards, they felt loose. So I kept jerking on them until one came free, then used it to pry up the entire seat.

 Afterwards, I stared down into the black water expecting to see disgusting things floating in it, but the light was too dim, I could hardly see the surface. So I held my breath and lowered myself into the opening. I meant to lower myself quietly to the water, but the slimy sides of the box made me shutter, and I let myself fall.

 I came up out of the icy water spitting and gasping for breath and paddled quickly to the dock. It was built on rock lined with thick timber to protect the hulls. I slipped under the timber and used the rough stones to pull myself along the water's edge until, after about twenty feet, I came to the bow of another ship.

 I was in trouble. I needed to get out of the water: already I could feel the cold water sapping my strength away. But I was still too close to the Sea Garage: they would see me climbing onto the dock. Ahead, I could see the gentle swells pushing the hull alternately into and then away from the dock. If I tried to slip between the hull and the dock, I would be crushed. I would have to swim around the ship and risk being seen in the open water.

 I looked back at the Sea Garage and forced myself to wait until I saw the crew hoist another load of cargo into the air. Hoping that it would occupy their attention, I swam out from the dock and around the bow.

 I began to tire. Desperately I felt along the hull but its smooth sides offered no handholds. Keep going; keep going, I told myself. I remembered another time when the waves kept pulling me under and I kept fighting my way back up until they gave up and dumped me onto the shore. All I had to do was keep going.

 Finally, at the ship's stern, my fingers found the rudder. I clung there only for a moment then I forced myself to cross the last bit of open water to the dock. Again I used the roughness of the rock to help me along, only this time I scrambled up over the timber and out of the water.

 Back at the Sea Garage, the women had stopped loading and were lighting torches. Searchers were just starting to move along the dock peering into the water and between stacks of cargo. My escape had been discovered.

 I looked around. The city was too dark: candle light flickered in the windows of a few scattered buildings and in the distance a torch guided someone on a night-time errand, but everything else was hidden in darkness. Everything except the searching torches, which came steadily closer.

 Across the dock, I could just make out the deeper blackness of an alley leading between buildings. But where to go? Who would have me now? 

 CHAPTER 6

 -- CAMPAIGNERS

 

 The trouble with escaping through a toilet is that you could never tell anyone how you did it. So when Scribbles and Tiny began arguing, I welcomed the distraction.

 "Go back to Farhaven," Scribbles said. "You're not safe here."

 Tiny disagreed, "No, stay here, we can take care of you."

 We were in the back room of the shop. While the girls had gotten me dried and seated by the fire I had told them about my kidnapping. Now, I blew on my tea and sipped at its surface. Some adventure. First I had failed to recruit Redblood, then Littlewolf, and finally the gypsies.

 "You don't need the gypsies," Saratan said. "We can help you."

 I hesitated. True, Tiny and Saratan were not so bad. But Scribbles was awful. Anyway they didn't know anything. I shook my head. "No. The gypsies know about the Elevator."

 "Elevator?" Scribbles asked. "What's that got to do with anything."

 "I've got to save it."

 "Can't," Scribbles declared. "The gypsies sealed the Spire."

 "Spire?"

 "It's where Towerhold gets its name -- a big rock that sticks up above the city. When the gypsies left, they sealed the Beast that controls the Elevator into the Spire. That's why it's falling."

 Could it be true? Where did Scribbles get these stories anyway?

 Well, she was right about one thing, I was not safe here. Captain Roma would try to recapture me. And, when word came from Farhaven, the Harbor Mistress would join in the chase. My only chance was to keep moving. And Scribbles had just told me where to go.

 "First thing tomorrow," I said, "I'm off to Towerhold."

 "Can I come too?" Tiny asked.

 "We'll all go," Saratan said.

 "Great," Scribbles said. "We get into the Spire, then the Beast eats us."

 "Come or not, but I'm leaving in the morning." I went to my bed and drew the blanket up over my head. Let the girls decide, then later, when I found a real company, it wouldn't me my fault.

 I pretended sleep and soon the girl's voices faded to murmurs. Was there really a beast? Would it really eat us?

 #

 Tiny was pushing on my shoulder. "Wake up," she said.

 The dawn was just beginning. A hint of gray lightened the windows, but the walls still flickered with the shadows of the girls. In the candlelight I could see them stuffing supplies into packs.

 Tiny worked quickly. She took gear from piles laid out on the floor and jammed it into the packs. First, she lined the bottom of the packs with winter gear -- coats, gloves, and padded boots -- and topped it off with lighter clothing. Next she found room for camp gear -- a pot, bowls and utensils, and packages of food.

 Saratan seemed more deliberate. She helped Tiny get the right gear in each pack and was constantly looking about to make sure nothing was missed or misplaced. Afterwards she helped tie bedrolls onto the packs. And onto the side of her pack, she tied a quiver full of arrows.

 Scribbles had a private project. She carefully smoothed quill feathers and stored them into her writing box. Then her fingers ran over the little compartments, checking that her inks, knives, paper, and blotters were all in place. Satisfied that all was well, she tied the lid shut and stored the box in her pack.

 "Breakfast everyone," Mother announced as she passed out bowls of hot cereal. I sat up and leaned against the wall to eat; the girls sat on their packs.

 The packs, and the early hour, could only mean one thing, but Saratan wanted it clear. "We've formed a company to take you to Towerhold." Then seeing my glance towards Scribbles, she added, "Scribbles too, she knows things."

 Knew them? More likely she made them up. Still, maybe she wasn't completely awful. I nodded in agreement.

 "Good," Saratan said and added, "finish your breakfast then put these clothes on."

 "But these are girls clothes," I protested when I felt the rough fabric.

 "Yes."

 "Oh." The farmers had mistaken me for a girl, so maybe everyone would. The disguise would conceal me from my pursuers and keep me from becoming a target for bandits while we were on the road.

 However, I think the girls meant to take advantage of me. I thought I looked plenty drab in the nut-brown blouse and trousers, but when I came out of the kitchen, Tiny handed me a pack. "Part of the disguise," she said.

 "Well, you didn't have to put all the heavy stuff in it." I didn't like the way the straps scraped at my shoulders.

 "I told you Bilbo wouldn't do it," Scribbles said.

 "Bilbo?"

 "It will give you away," Scribbles explained, "if we call you Gypsy."

 "I know that," I snapped. "But 'Bilbo?' What kind of name is that?"

 Scribbles laughed. "Oh, it's a good name for a boy on a quest."

 "A quest?" Tiny interrupted. "Is that what we're on? A quest?"

 "Yes," Scribbles replied. "That's what they call an improbable adventure, a quest."

 #

 "Something's happening," Saratan declared.

 She was right. With the sun barely up, one expected empty streets, but people were everywhere. Some stood around in small groups exchanging gossip, but most seemed intent on errands. And when we reached the market, we saw vendors hustling about, setting up their stalls and calling out to the crowd.

 "Gypsies," I said as I grabbed Saratan's arm and pointed across the market square. Two women wearing red bandannas were leaning against a stone wall near the city gates. They acted casual, like idle loiterers, but their eyes were busy scanning the crowd.

 "Don't point," Saratan said as she pulled my arm down and led us behind a tent.

 Tiny peered around the tent. "There's only two, we can beat them."

 "Two? They have everyone up and after us," Scribbles said. "We're going to get caught."

 "Calm down," Saratan ordered as she drew Tiny back out of sight. "No one would help the gypsies capture a boy. Something else is happening."

 Saratan was right. The crowd was excited, but they were talking and moving things. Not searching.

 I took a turn peeking around the tent. Maybe the crowd wasn't searching, but the gypsies were. Their eyes never stopped moving. "So how do we get out?" I asked.

 "They're looking for a boy," Saratan said. She couldn't resist peeking either. "We can walk right past them, just don't act nervous, and don't look at them."

 Saratan sounded confident, but I noticed that she took a deep breath and hitched up her pack before she stepped from behind the tent and strode towards the gate. Tiny also pulled her pack higher on her shoulders when she stepped out behind Saratan.

 "Look at the vendors," Scribbles said as she pushed me ahead of her.

 Sensible advice I'm sure. However, as we crossed the open space before the gate, I could feel the gypsies' eyes on me, boring though my disguise. Eventually, I could stand it no longer and looked up at them.

 One gypsy was polishing an apple; the other, looking across the market. We were invisible.

 #

 Outside the city gates, we entered into a sea of commotion: tents collapsed; justices shouted orders; warriors assembled and marched off; horses snorted and fought their harnesses. The army was breaking camp.

 Saratan left us alongside the road and went off to find out what was happening. Under strict orders to stick together and stay put, we shouted questions at passing women to piece the story together for ourselves.

 Mercid the Mad had occupied old Fort Rincon. In the old days the fort had guarded against barbarian raids from the Badlands. But after the farmer's army had cleared the Badlands, it had been unneeded and eventually abandoned. Now, Mercid had camped her bandit army in the empty fort.

 She declared herself Mistress of the Badlands and sent out a call for all women without men to join her. They would resettle the Badlands and establish a new regime where all men were shared equally among the women.

 Her plan was clear. The fort not only gave her a strong defensive position but its location gave her control of the road to Towerhold. The land was cut in two. But life in the land was too fragile to survive without the caravans. If the farmers failed to dislodge her, they would have to sue for peace and give in to her evil designs.

 #

 "We will follow the army," Saratan said when she returned. "When they clear Mercid from the road, we'll go on to Towerhold."

 She led us to a train of wagons just getting underway. Horses, driven by the sharp snap of the whips, strained against their harnesses and the heavy wagons lurched into motion. We were allowed to throw our packs onto the rear wagon and walk alongside.

 Saratan explained that she knew Adide, the mistress of this caravan. Like us, she was following the army, hoping to deliver cloth goods to the eastern cities. When Saratan told her that she was taking youngsters to school in Towerhold, Adide invited her to join the caravan.

 I fell into stride alongside the girls. I wanted to run, to hurry the journey, but knew from the previous trek that hour after hour of the slow steady pace would drain my energy. And on this journey, I would not be allowed to rest in the wagons: that was a privilege allowed boys, not human girls or those pretending to be such.

 #

 Even before the sun got directly overhead, I began wondering when we would stop for lunch. But when we rounded the curve of a hill and saw the line of women, horses, and wagons snaking steadily across the next valley, I lost hope for a stop. The column stayed on the road and marched onwards until it disappeared into a cloud of dust kicked up by the passing feet.

 I looked at the girls, but they chattered on, looking, for all I could tell, as fresh as when we started.

 "What about the Beast?" Tiny asked. "What's it like?"

 "No one knows," Scribbles said. "Some say it's an alien, very powerful."

 So she didn't know everything. I handed the Beast Card to Tiny. "This is it."

 While they studied the card, I wiped sweat from my brow. The day was too hot. And too dry: already the cloud of dust, looking like the smoke from a forest fire, rose above the road ahead.

 Tiny surrendered the Beast card to Scribbles. "It looks mean."

 Scribbles looked thoughtful. "We need to know more, maybe when we get to Towerhold, they'll let us into the Library."

 "Not girls." Not human girls, I meant. The gypsies had founded the Library when they ruled at Towerhold, but the farmers had made it into a school for boys. Human girls would not be welcome there.

 "Maybe -- " Tiny sneezed as the dust tickled her nose " -- they'll let Gypsy in."

 "Bilbo," Saratan reminded us.

 "I'm a girl, remember." The dust caught in my throat and made me cough.

 Scribbles handed the Beast card back to me and began tying a handkerchief around her nose and mouth. "We'll think of a story, the mother will know."

 "There's a mother in Towerhold?"

 The handkerchiefs kept the worst of the dust out, but your breath felt hot and sticky. And when you tried to talk, cloth got sucked into your mouth and made you want to spit, except your lips were too dry.

 #

 I knelt besides the bucket and splashed water on my face. I should have been resting. But no. When the setting sun had finally forced the army to stop, Saratan had handed me the bucket and sent me to fetch water.

 The water turned the dust to mud as it ran off my face, but I finished washing and filled the bucket, only to discover that when I lifted it, the wire handle hurt my hands. So I had to carry it a few feet, set it down, change hands, and lug it another few feet all the way back to the camp.

 The girls should have helped me, but Tiny pretended to be busy building a fire and Scribbles was fiddling with dinner. And Saratan was off talking to the caravan mistress, not doing any work at all.

 I dropped my bucket near Scribbles.

 "Hey!" She complained when water splashed on her.

 I ignored her and sat down to lean against a tree. Now that they had lowered their handkerchiefs, the girls had masks of dark-gray dust that outlined their eyes. When we catch up with Mercid, she'll claim we're the bandits...

 #

 Tiny was shaking me again. "Wake up."

 Didn't she have anyone else to bother? I pushed her away and kept my eyes closed, but the clamor of shouting women, braying horses, and cracking whips prevented a return to sleep. When dust tickled my nostrils, I sneezed and opened my eyes. Morning had come and the army was moving again.

 "Hurry up," Tiny said. Our last wagon was already moving and Saratan and Scribbles were tossing our packs aboard.

 Hurry up she said, but she wasn't the one hobbling along on stiff muscles.

 "Breakfast." Scribbles handed me a bun with a filling that smelled of hot eggs and sausage.

 Never mind that the rising dust made it taste gritty. The aroma triggered my hunger, so I ate while marching. And soon my leg muscles loosened, allowing me to keep stride alongside the girls.

 #

 Mid-morning, the column stopped.

 "What's happening?" Tiny asked.

 No one answered. All morning, the dust and the handkerchiefs had stifled conversation. We had become so accustomed to marching in silence, that we milled aimlessly about, seemingly unable to either speak or stop.

 Gradually the dust settled, and when everyone began lowering their handkerchiefs, Saratan led us to a shady tree by the side of the road.

 "Why don't they tell us what's happening?" Tiny asked.

 They never did, but later when we started moving again, the dust was not so bad. A good trade, I thought.

 #

 "What's that?" Tiny asked. She pointed ahead to where women were digging alongside the road.

 At first it made no sense, digging holes in the wilderness, but as we passed we saw more women lying behind the mounds of dirt. They could have been sleeping, except for the red-brown stains of their wounds. The women were digging graves.

 "I knew it," Scribbles said. "There's been fighting, we should have stayed in Calmwater."

 When I glanced to Saratan, her eyes were scanning the trees on either side of us. And her fingers were pulling at the little strap that held her sword in place. And I noticed that the women in the wagons were all fiddling with their weapons too.

 "If there's fighting," Saratan told us, "get on the ground, don't run for cover, don't expose yourselves, and don't draw attention."

 Tiny rebelled. "We want to fight."

 "Do as you are told."

 #

 Later, when the column stopped again, Adide ordered her drivers to dismount and stand guard on each side of the road.

 "Stay with Adide," Saratan said. She checked that her sword was free and began walking down the road, towards the bandits.

 "Where's she going?" Tiny asked.

 "She'll get killed," Scribbles complained. "Then what will we do?"

 When Saratan disappeared around a bend in the road, we looked at each other, and at the woods, and at the wagons. Adide's women, even the guards, seemed relaxed. Not that they were lax: they kept their eyes on the woods. But they leaned against their wagons and no one was fiddling with their weapons. The other women got busy watering the horses.

 A few minutes later, a group of women came scurrying up the road, headed towards the rear of the column. As they passed, Adide reached out and grabbed one woman by the arm. "What are you doing?" she demanded.

 "We've been beat." The woman's eyes shifted frantically between the front and rear of the column. "Clear out now if you value your skins." She pulled away and hurried after her companions.

 "Wait," Adide called after her. "Would you live a coward?" But the woman, and her fellow deserters kept going.

 Adide stared after them until they were gone, then she spit on the road. And when she looked up and saw her drivers looking at her, she growled, "Have you no work to do?"

 The guards, I noticed, were all standing erect and looking very intently at the woods. And when Adide turned and stomped towards the head of her caravan, I scampered out of her way. No sense getting scowled at.

 #

 "It's Saratan," Tiny said as she jumped to her feet. She ran down the road, pulled something from Saratan's grasp, and came running back, holding it high in the air. It was a bow.

 Saratan arrived carrying several bows in her hands and quivers filled with arrows slung over her shoulder. She handed a bow to Scribbles, then to me.

 I made a face.

 "Part of your disguise," she explained.

 Just what I needed. Something else to carry. The bow felt heavy in my hand, and awkward: it was longer than I was tall.

 "I'm going to kill lots of bandits," Tiny bragged. She had gotten her bow strung and fitted an arrow, only to have it drop to the ground as she drew on the string.

 Only Saratan laughed. Scribbles was still struggling to get her bow strung. And my eyes were focused on a reddish-brown stain near the end of my bow. I poked at it with my finger. Sticky. Just as I thought. Saratan had gotten them from the dead.

 "When you are through fooling," Saratan said as she turned to leave, "come see me for a lesson."

 "We want to shot them now," Tiny said.

 "This bow is too heavy," I told Scribbles. "Trade me?"

 My new bow turned out to be no lighter, but it was clean.

 Saratan, when she finally got our attention, began: "There are three types of arrows, arrows that have the shaft trimmed to a point are for practice; there are no barbs to snag in the target. Arrows with blades are for hunting or fighting; hunting blades run up and down so they will slip between an animal's ribs; war blades run side to side so they will slip between a woman's ribs."

 She showed us how to string a bow and made us practice until it became one smooth motion: brace the bow against a foot; bend with a leg and one hand; slip the string into the notch with the other hand.

 And she showed us how to shoot: grip the bow in the center and use a forefinger to hold the arrow while it is notched and adjusted square with the bow; keep the bow arm straight and fully extended; use a split fingered grip to draw arrow and string back together; keep the elbow high and touch thumb to ear; sight along the shaft; release.

 We had only a short practice before the column began moving again, but even so I was glad to stop: my forearm stung from the slap of the string and my shoulder ached from the strain of pulling against the stiff wood.

 #

 As we approached into the shadow of the Rincons, the fighting became increasingly intense. At first the bandits staged ambushes, hiding in bushes until the column got close, then rising to release flights of arrows before fleeing into the forest. To counter the ambushes the army spread out into a skirmish line that must have been miles wide. Slowly the bandits were forced back towards the fort.

 We would move forward then stop; forward, stop. For explanation we had only the usual rumors: the fighting was heavy; we were going to retreat; the bandits had been routed. But Adide's routine never varied: move forward when you can, stand guard when you can't. At least the dust was gone. With the army in the field, only the supply wagons and caravans occupied the road.

 And we had the archery practice to occupy our minds. By the second day, we could get arrows launched so that they flew true and in the right direction. And three days later, when we finally reached Fort Rincon, we could even hit targets.

 #

 We could not see the fort from the wagon camp, but Saratan let us go forward with her and Mistress Adide to survey the situation. We climbed a small rise and looked across a small valley to the fort.

 Fort Rincon stood atop a low hill where it guarded a gap leading into the mountain pass. When the forces from Calmwater had threatened to cut them off, bandits that had been holding the gap had been forced to fall back into the fort, letting the army from Towerhold through the gap.

 Now the two armies surrounded the fort. The reds, greens, and yellows of brightly colored pennants decorated the drab canvas of their camp tents. The tents covered the valley floor, spreading from the gap to sweep around the fort and extend into the steep mountain slopes to the north.

 Mistress Adide was interested in the road, which ran through the camp, wound around the base of the hill, and disappeared into the gap. "Watch," she said.

 A caravan, eager to be off to Towerhold was making its way down the road. We could see the wagoneers whipping the horses, hurrying past the fort. But just as the caravan reached the base of the hill, bandits swept down the slope.

 In response, warriors from the camp charged through the caravan and up the slope only to be thrown back by the downhill charge of the bandits. Both sides released great black flights of arrows that mowed down rows of warriors.

 The caravan disappeared in the swirl of fighting, but when the bandits retreated back up the hill, we could see wagons and horses strewn along the road among the bodies of dead and injured women.

 Mistress Adide spoke to Saratan, "Our wagons will be staying put. But if you are anxious to get your girls though, you might make it by hiking them over the rough ground. Stay away from the fort."

 Saratan looked to the west, towards the setting sun and said, "In the morning."

 #

 "Wake up."

 The morning sky was already getting light but the girls were still in their bedrolls. Saratan, when I pushed on her shoulder, growled and swatted at me, then rolled over. Tiny and Scribbles didn't even move. They had stayed up too late last night, listening to war stories. And drinking wine, no doubt.

 When Mistress Adide's cook saw me up, she waived me over and we shared an early breakfast of pancakes drowned in syrup. And she gave me hot coffee to sip at until the girls finally stirred and got busy with their own breakfast.

 Afterwards, Saratan fussed at us. All our gear had to be stowed properly in our packs and the quivers tied on just so. And after we hefted the packs onto our backs, she made us practice extracting arrows by reaching over our shoulders.

 Sunlight was already flickering through the trees as Saratan led us down the road. In summer the gnarly branches that snaked out from the black trunks would have formed a canopy over the road. But now the barren wood did nothing to protect us from the morning breeze. It blew out of the mountains, across the valley, and into our faces as we trudged down the road.

 On the road, the bright light and chill wind forced our heads down, so when we finally stepped out into the valley and looked up, the fort loomed unexpectedly over us. In the sunlight, the ramparts seemed impossibly high, and completely impregnable.

 "Well look here, we've been rescued."

 I looked to the side of the road to see a woman smirking at us. She was heating water over a fire, and behind her, another woman was in their open tent, fussing with a bloody bandage on a third woman. Their weapons, swords and pikes, were leaned neatly against a log, ready for use.

 I glanced at Saratan, but she was busy surveying the camp. Tents spread endlessly towards the east until they were lost in the haze from the camp fires. Paying no heed to the woman, she stepped around her tent onto a path that led eastwards through the camp.

 "You'll be sorry," the woman called out behind us.

 The path led past hundreds of camp tents where little companies of three or four, or sometimes five, women were busy with their breakfasts and camp chores. At many tents the women were busy changing the bandages of wounded comrades, but even the wounded seemed cheerful. They were women confident of victory.

 A justice, however, did not share the usual good humor. Looking harassed and preoccupied with the business of running an army, she snapped orders when we passed, "You. Human girls! Report to the Justice General's headquarters. They need more runners."

 I kept my head down and followed Saratan along the path.

 "Hey, you deaf?" The justice shouted behind us. We turned to see her pointing towards the fort. A large canopy marked with purple pennants sat on top of a low rise next to the road. The justice was directing us into the heart of the battleground.

 Saratan looked at me. "We had better tell them you're a boy," she whispered.

 "No. They'll send me back to Farhaven."

 I followed Saratan's glance back at the justice. She was standing, hands on hips, staring impatiently at us.

 Saratan started down a new path that led us off towards the headquarters tent. I tried not to look at the road, or think too much about yesterday's carnage.

 #

 At the headquarters we found another justice pacing impatiently in a little clearing behind the tent. "Runners' gear goes there," she said.

 My eyes followed her gesture but I couldn't see anything until I got closer to the rocks bordering the clearing. A couple of packs sat on bedrolls that were spread out in a little gap in the rocks.

 "There's no room," I complained. "And don't we get a tent?"

 "Oh, it's the picnic you're looking for," the justice said as she snagged my arm. "And here I was thinking you came for the war." She continued speaking as she turned me eastwards, "Well, if it's not too much trouble, maybe you could find the Justice of Markets and tell her we need her at the noon conference."

 "Markets?"

 She waved vaguely down the road. "Work around towards the gap. Look for a green and yellow pennant."

 The justice released me and pointed Tiny off to the west. "Run over to the red pennant and..."

 Saratan, when I looked to her, held my eyes only for an instant, then we both looked anxiously up the road. A crew of women was working at lifting the carcass of a horse onto a wagon. "Stay clear of the road," she said. "You'll be okay."

 #

 I'm in trouble, I thought. I could already hear the justice starting her lecture about the importance of delivering messages.

 But the last tent was behind me, and ahead, the empty road crossed my path and rose steeply into the gap. And when I turned and looked anxiously back, I could see nothing of a green and yellow pennant. Worse, from my position on the valley slope, the entire stretch of the road was visible, so I couldn't have missed it.

 A faint sniff of fresh baked bread brought sudden hunger pangs to my stomach and drew my eyes away from the road. But the nearby campfires were out or untended. No one was cooking. Besides the smoke was drifting away from me.

 I turned and raised my eyes into the gap. Was that smoke? Someone was up there. The impassable rocks that guarded the gap kept pushing my eyes towards the road. Saratan had said to keep off it, but it was the only way up. Besides, I was well past the fort. And they had bread up there. Maybe I could get lunch.

 The trudge up the road was short but steep, so when I topped the rise, I had to pause for breath. The ground ahead widened and flattened out into one of those little meadows you find in the mountain passes. This meadow was filled with tents, and stacks of goods, and row after row of smoking ovens. Everywhere women were tending fires or horses or unloading wagons.

 So I wasn't in trouble. The green and yellow pennant flew over a tent near the ovens.

 But just as I started forward to deliver the message, cracking whips caught my attention. Beyond the camp, a caravan of empty wagons was heading into the gap. I could see them pulling onto the road and rounding a little bend where they disappeared behind the canyon walls.

 The girls. If I could get them up here, we could catch a ride. But a glance at the wagons told me there was no time. They would be gone in a few minutes.

 Behind me, the fort was just visible over my shoulder. It sat there, messing up all my plans. Maybe I should go alone. Saving the Elevator was the important thing. All the girls had done was get me drafted into a war. I could be stuck here all winter.

 I should have gone, but I was still standing when the last wagon disappeared around the bend. I suppose that, even if they don't amount to much, you can't just walk away from your company.

 Maybe, I thought as I headed towards the green and yellow pennant, they'll have some lunch. 

 CHAPTER 7

 -- HUMANS

 

 The trouble with war is that no one cares if a runner gets hungry: they just keep sending you on more errands. If the justices hadn't been called to headquarters, I might never have got to eat.

 When I finally reached the headquarters tent, I saw Tiny standing by the rocks at the runners' camp. She was helping a red-headed girl set out a tray of sandwiches.

 I made a little show of exhaling loudly and wiping my brow. "I've been everywhere."

 "I was in the fighting this morning," Tiny said.

 "Fighting? Where is Saratan? Scribbles?" The red-headed girl tried to brush my hand away from the tray, but I snatched the fattest sandwich and began eating it.

 "Bandits tried to rush the headquarters this morning after you left, Saratan is with Jurist Anne, Scribbles is in the tent writing messages, this Robyn, she's in Jurist Anne's company."

 "We've got a real company," Robyn said as she moved the tray out of my reach. "After the war, we're going to compete at University for a courtship."

 So we were not a real company? At least we're not liars. "Courtship?" I mumbled between bytes. "Boys don't court with humans." And she was definitely human. Her skin had reddened and freckled from the sun and was marred by white patches where it had peeled.

 "They'll court with us, Anne is heir to the High Court, Perigee let her shake his hand once, before the war."

 "Perigee?"

 "Just the most handsome boy ever," she claimed.

 "Not as handsome as our boy," Tiny retorted.

 Robyn laughed. "Liars! You got no boy."

 "Watch your mouth!" I pushed at her shoulder, only I never touched her: she grabbed my arm and pulled me forward. Tiny jumped on her as I was going down, but in an instant Robyn had one arm locked around Tiny's head and was using the other to push my face into the dirt.

 "Robyn, let them go," a new voice commanded.

 I spit dirt from my mouth and looked up. No one said, but I figured the new girl to be the Jurist. She wore clothes of rank, hard leather armor over clothing dyed purple and held together with silver studs. And although her dark eyes sat deeply behind a hooked nose that marked her as human, they sparked with the intensity of command.

 Robyn let us go right away, but Saratan, who was with the Jurist, gave Robyn a black look and brushed past her. Robyn bristled and looked ready to fight, but the Jurist touched her arm. "Let's eat," she said.

 Scribbles joined us as the girls were picking out their sandwiches. "We'll be here all winter," she said.

 "Maybe not," the Jurist said as she sat down. "We've got them locked up now." Of course she took the best seat, a flat rock in the middle of the camp.

 When I picked a seat well away from her, Saratan and Tiny joined me, but Scribbles was too busy to notice. "Doesn't matter," she claimed. "I did the numbers for the Justice General. They've got lots of supplies."

 I glared at Robyn. All the sandwiches were gone now, and mine was smashed. I did mange to pick most of the dirt off it, but eating it made my nose wrinkle.

 #

 As usual, the lunch break was too short. The noon conference produced messages and orders to be delivered. Jurist Anne assigned an important sounding message to Robyn then sent Saratan and Tiny off on minor errands. An urgent order for the archers she claimed for herself, leaving me as the lone runner remaining at headquarters.

 I passed time plotting revenge on the other company. We were the ones with the real company, the ones with a boy. We should have been getting the important jobs. And Robyn had to pay for making me eat dirt.

 My undoing was going inside to see what Scribbles was doing. In the center of the tent, justices sat around a table debating some point of strategy. Scribbles sat in the far corner. I looked at the justices, but no one was paying any attention to me, so I worked my way quietly around the table.

 Scribbles sat in the corner at her own little table. Her writing box sat neatly to one side, but sheets of paper spread haphazardly over the remaining surface. One of the quills in her box caught my eye and I picked it up to examine the bright yellow and black stripes on the feather.

 "Don't," Scribbles whispered. She took the quill from me and carefully returned it to the box.

 "I was just looking." My eyes focused on her papers. She was working on lists -- lists of justices, lists of companies they commanded, lists of supplies on hand, lists of supplies needed.

 Suddenly a hand gripped my arm. "Great Law! What are you doing here?"

 I tried to twist away, but someone held me firmly in her grasp. It was the Mechanic Axeblade. Where had she come from?

 Her exclamation interrupted the conference. A woman asked, "Axeblade? You have an interest in this human girl?"

 "It's no girl," she explained. "It's a boy. A runaway."

 #

 What bad luck! The human girls, the new ones, had caused it. If Anne had only sent me on an errand I might have avoided Axeblade. But no, Anne had kept the good jobs for herself and Robyn, so now I was under house arrest and confined to Axeblade's tent.

 Once again, I moved to the back of the tent, and getting down on my hands and knees, cautiously lifted the fabric. And again, seeing boot clad feet, I dropped it back into place. Axeblade's guards were not cooperating: their constant alertness prevented me from slipping away.

 An unexpected voice startled me. "Maybe we should double the guard."

 I looked up to see Redblood at the entrance flap. She was smirking at having caught me. I scrambled to my feet and tried to act casual but couldn't keep my face from flushing.

 My embarrassment was quickly forgotten, though, when I saw the bandage on her arm. "Are you all right?" I asked.

 "Just a scratch."

 "What you get for wearing a target." Her company patch was a red circle sewn onto the sleeve above the wound. I touched it to read the name stitched into the fabric. Apogee had chosen well -- Mech Raiders, a fighting name.

 She shook her head in mock dismay while she scanned my costume. "Ugly girl."

 "I'm quite popular with the boys."

 She turned serious. "Littlewolf has been hurt. She wants to see you."

 "Is it bad?"

 "Bad enough."

 #

 The mechanics held the western end of the crescent surrounding the fort. Axeblade's tent sat in a little flat on the mountain slope where it anchored the very end of the battle line.

 Redblood led me down the slope and into the trees away from the fort. Before long we came to a little clearing filled with tents that crowded against the bank of a small stream.

 I spotted Yellowbird's black hair and Shortbull's stocky build. When they saw us approach, they rose up from tending a fire and I was glad to see that neither one appeared wounded.

 "Hello," I said.

 I offered them my hand and was relieved when they shook it. Still, we were shy with each other and didn't quite know what to say. They opened a flap for me and I went into their tent.

 Littlewolf lay asleep in her bedroll. Heavy blankets covered her body and hid her wound, but above her head, a tangled mat of once golden hair attested to her distress.

 She must have sensed my presence, because when I sat down beside her, she opened her eyes and smiled in recognition.

 "You know," I said, "if boys ran the world, there wouldn't be any wars."

 "Where were you? The Mechanic thought we had you." Her voice came out hardly more than a whisper.

 "Where are you hurt?" I asked.

 She let me lift the blanket to look at the bandage on her upper chest. An arrow nicked her lung, she told me, but she was better now and would be walking in a few days. And when I lifted the bandage, the wound did appear to be healing. Although it was not yet healed over, the pink flesh looked clean and free from infection.

 We talked for a while. I did get around to apologizing for the dirty trick I had played on her when I ran off. We even managed to laugh about how Axeblade had threatened to hang her.

 But I was vague about my adventures: Axeblade would overreact if she heard stories of bandits and kidnappings. I had been to Calmwater was all I said.

 #

 When Redblood escorted me back up the slope, we found Axeblade outside her tent. She stood with her captains making gestures towards the fort. Redblood put me into the tent and left to join the conference. I had nothing to do, but I could hear them talking outside the tent, so I listened as they made their plans.

 The bandits suffered frightful casualties whenever they sortied from the fort, so the Justice General planned to send more caravans down the road to draw them out. Later, after their numbers were reduced, the farmers would assault the fort.

 The mechanics were to attack the fort's western tower. Women with swords and shields were to use ladders to reach the ramparts while the archers were to provide covering fire. They talked on for a long time, discussing details of ladder construction and making duty assignments.

 Finally the voices stopped and the entrance curtains parted as Axeblade stepped into the tent. I braced myself for the coming lecture, but she calmly sat down and remarked with a quiet voice, "Those human girls you were with, they have been asking about you."

 "Oh?"

 "I told them that they should be worrying about themselves."

 "What do you mean?"

 "By rights I should have them arrested. Taking a boy without permission is a serious offense."

 I felt a tightness in my chest. And surprise that a threat to the girls could affect me so. "They were only trying to help me."

 "Taking you onto a battlefield?"

 My eyes shifted to the tent wall behind her while she explained the importance of selecting proper companions and behaving in a manner appropriate to my station. The afternoon sun shone strongly onto the tent fabric. I could see shadows of the women outside as they went about their duties.

 Her tone changed. What did she say? Something about getting me off the battlefield.

 "If Littlewolf was healthy," she continued, "I would have her take you back to Farhaven."

 "I'm on my way to Towerhold."

 "Hum. Perhaps we should consider the Justice General's offer."

 She paused, making me prompt her. "Offer?"

 "Yes, she thinks it might be good for you to enter the University at Towerhold."

 "That doesn't sound too bad." It sounded perfect. Scribbles said the ancient texts kept there might have clues about the Elevator.

 "She is offering to sponsor you in exchange for a courtship with her daughter, the Jurist Anne."

 So Robyn had been lying! They had no prospects for a courtship. "I already have a company," I announced rather smugly.

 Her voice rose in sudden concern, "A marriage?"

 "No. I didn't mean that. They're helping me. That's all."

 She sighed. "Sorry. I worry about you more than I should perhaps."

 She went on to explain that boys at the University often courted with several companies. The courtship with Jurist Anne would not be exclusive, Littlewolf would join me when she healed, and I would not have to make any choices until the spring contests.

 #

 The morning sun climbed over the mountains, warming us as we sat leaning against our packs. When Anne and her girls started up the little rise to Axeblade's tent, we rose and hefted our packs onto our backs.

 "Good Morning," Anne said when they reached us.

 "Good Morning," I replied as we pushed past them and headed down the rise, making them follow us back in the direction they had just come.

 Saratan led us through the camp, around the fort, and onto the road. Soon she fell into the relentless caravan pace, and we trudged upwards into the gap.

 Robyn caught up with me. "I'm sorry. If you want, I'll resign. There's no need to take it out on Anne."

 "You're wrong," I said. "A company stands or falls together. You're both one to me."

 After that Anne and Robyn trailed along in silence. The silence affected us too: although the road allowed us to walk two and sometimes three abreast, the presence of the other company seemed as tangible and stifling as the dust.

 Around noon we crossed the divide and started down into the Land, but memories of the spectacular view from Gates Pass made the crossing a disappointment. I expected to see a grand vista, but we remained locked in the gap: the canyon walls blocked our view.

 "It's not fair," I said to Saratan during lunch.

 "Fair?"

 "Well remember Gates Pass. We could see the sea. This is a stupid road."

 Saratan shrugged, but Anne responded. "There's a trail up ahead, it leads to a lookout where you can see the whole of the Land."

 "Oh?"

 "We can take you there."

 "Well maybe."

 #

 In the afternoon Anne stopped us where a small stream spilled clear water across the road. She led us upstream along what she claimed was a trail. We wormed our way between charcoal boulders, waded across the stream a half dozen times, and climbed slippery rock to the canyon rim. At the top, we struggled across a slope of loose gravel to the lookout.

 The view, though, was everything Anne promised. The ever present Eastern Elevator rose over new shapes that she was eager to explain. "See the Spire, there, where it sticks up above the escarpment, that's Towerhold."

 The escarpment formed the eastern boundary of the Land. Even in the distance you could see that the ground had broken away in some ancient upheaval. The Spire was a black spike of rock that had been thrown up during the cataclysm.

 Closer and somewhat to the north, Haystack Mountain sprawled across the center of the Land. At its base a column of smoke rose from the furnaces at Forge. Coal from the mountain provided the energy to melt down steel beams stripped from the ruins of ancient cities. Everything metal -- plows, swords, horseshoes -- came from Forge.

 But the patchwork quilt at our feet formed the essence of the Land. When the Western Elevator fell, the machines of the old Femdom stopped, leaving the people without tools or stored knowledge. Only the farmers, always close to the soil, had been able to cope. Now their farms formed the new civilization. They spread out below us and swept around both sides of Haystack mountain to fill the fertile valley.

 #

 "We should camp here tonight," Anne said.

 Saratan glanced to the west where the sun had already set behind the Rincons and then looked east to see their shadows spreading over the land. She nodded.

 Anne pointed to the rear of the lookout where a rock wall made a natural windbreak. "We'll build the fire over there." And with a gesture towards a stand of tress she added, "Tiny maybe you can find some wood? And see if there is any water in that gully."

 When Tiny scampered across the hillside to the trees, Anne turned to survey the ground in the lookout. "We should find places to sleep while we can still see."

 The best spot was against the rock wall, near the fire, so I picked up my pack and carried it over. Robyn was there scooping shallow holes into the ground. "That's my spot."

 She looked up like she meant to argue, but didn't. She just stood and brushed dirt from her hands, until I dropped my pack and began kicking the dirt back into the holes. "It's more comfortable if you have depressions for your hips and shoulders."

 "I know that." I dropped to my knees and began clearing pebbles and twigs from the ground.

 "There's water," Tiny announced. She dumped an armful of branches near the spot where Anne wanted the fire.

 "Robyn, perhaps you can take your bucket?" Anne suggested.

 After I felt Robyn move away, I pushed the dirt back out of her holes, spread out my bedroll, and lay down to test my bed. Robyn was right, the depressions made it more comfortable.

 That night, after dinner, I lay under my blanket and stared eastwards at the Elevator. Why was there always a new problem? Now Anne was taking command. Even Saratan was following her orders. I suppose Anne had the right: she was the Jurist; and I had agreed to court with her. But she had no reason, no commitment, to help me with the Elevator.

 #

 At Market, we joined a caravan heading for Towerhold. I welcomed the luxury of being rid of the pack and riding in the wagons when I felt lazy.

 We again saw the Spire many days before we reached Towerhold. The caravan had rounded the flank of Haystack mountain and there it was, a black finger of rock jutting up into the eastern sky.

 It became a beacon drawing us onward. It would disappear from time to time as the road dropped down into the valleys. But then we would round another bend or top a rise and there it would be again. Each time we saw it, it would seem closer yet still distant.

 When I mentioned this feeling to the girls, Scribbles said, "Well yes, each day we travel half-way to the Spire, but the problem is, after each day's travel we still have half-way to go, so you see that each day we do get closer, but because we always have half-way left to go, we can never actually get there."

 "Huh?"

 Scribbles was facing straight ahead, but I knew from the way she watched me out of the corner of her eye, that she was smirking. And she gave me no chance to think. "When we travel half-way," she asked, "how far do we have left?"

 "Half-way."

 "And when we travel half of that?"

 Half-way. Could it be true? Would the Spire -- no matter how far we traveled -- always be another march away?

 No. Scribbles was teasing. I was sure of that. I just had to find the flaw in her logic. That night when the girls had finished their chores, I sat next to her. "Tell me."

 She seemed not to hear my order. "Is this a pimple?" she asked. Her fingers traced around a white bump on the side of her jaw. She had made the skin around it red and bruised with futile attempts to squeeze it.

 "Here let me." I had seen the girls doing this, but when I pushed at the pimple with my forefingers, I was still surprised at the sudden eruption.

 "Oh." Scribbles flinched away.

 "Yuk." The puss shot into the air and disappeared, probably onto me somewhere.

 She started to squirm away but I leaned my weight against her to keep her down. "Let me see."

 "Don't."

 I squeezed again but only blood came out of the little crater. "Here's another one. Want me to get it?"

 She squirmed some more, but I got right on top of her, so she couldn't get away.

 "Hurry up."

 "Can't. When I get half done, I'll always have half to go. Remember?"

 #

 Fortunately the time did come when the road topped a rise and revealed to us the whole of the great Spire. Its base was surrounded by a wall that must have been thirty feet high and perhaps just as thick. Inside the wall, we could see the upper stories of buildings and towers. To the south, a lake lapped at the wall, and before us, the ground was leveled and cleared of bush and trees. Any enemy intent on assaulting the walls would have to do it without benefit of cover.

 This was Towerhold, the city where the gypsies had once guarded the pathway to the stars, where I must somehow find a way to undo centuries of neglect. I felt a rising tightness in my chest as the caravan made its way towards the walls. It made me dizzy to look up at the Spire. Even the walls towered over us. Like tiny motes we entered the gaping hole they called the main gate.

 #

 Just inside the wall was an open plaza that, flanked by inns and stables, formed a staging area for arriving and departing caravans. We extracted our packs from the wagons, said our good-byes, and made our way into the city.

 What a drab city it seemed: narrow streets of stone separated buildings of uniformly gray rock. Later I would discover some of the many gardens that lay hidden behind the stone walls. But on that first journey through the streets of Towerhold, I saw nothing living except an occasional weed struggling in the cracks.

 We went through the city and found a street that dove steeply down to enter a tunnel at the base of the wall. Cobblestones gave way to gravel as we came out of the tunnel and started across the causeway to the Island School.

 Once the island had been the site of the gypsy throne. But now it looked more like a ruin than a castle. On the right, one of the twin towers that guarded the causeway had collapsed. I could see women working in the scaffolding that covered the left tower.

 "What are they doing?" I asked.

 "Putting the towers back up," Anne replied. "The castle was in bad shape when the Sisters bought it. We've had to rebuild everything."

 Beyond the towers an expanse of green sat before a stout looking mansion. Children were playing on the grass.

 "It's Anne! It's Anne!" They shouted.

 She caught one, then two, of the girls in her arms and carried them as we made our way to the building. "Did you win the war? Did you kill the bandits?" they asked.

 "Better," Anne claimed as she turned them towards me. "I brought a boy."

 The little girls looked me over. "I'm Itty," one of them announced. "This is Bitty, we're twins," she added to introduce her companion. How handy. They looked and dressed exactly alike. The grownups would never know who was supposed to be in trouble.

 When we reached the mansion, an older woman, one of those humans with wrinkles and white hair, stepped from the door to investigate. She looked anxiously towards Anne. "Is everyone all right? No one hurt?"

 "We're fine, I've brought a guest," Anne said as she let the kids down and pulled me forward. "Mother, this is Gypsy."

 "It's a boy," Itty added.

 The mother shook my hand, and when I asked, she explained that, like the mother in Calmwater, she took in young human girls, gave them an education, and helped them find jobs. She was the leader of the alliance that the human girls called the Sisters.

 #

 "Come, I want to show you," Anne said. She took me into the mansion. She pointed out the freshly plastered walls, neatly tiled floors, and brightly polished woodwork. "We've rebuilt everything, and it can all be yours, the island can belong to the gypsies again."

 Opening a door, she said, "You'll stay tonight in the king's quarters."

 It was an exotic sort of room, something a gypsy king might well favor. Along one wall, glass paned windows overlooked a private garden; on the other walls, red and green tapestries framed a canopied bed, a writing desk, and a sunken bath. In the center of the room, a throne guarded a shallow pit filled with fine white sand.

 I sat on the throne and gestured towards the sand. "What is this?"

 Her head tilted playfully. "Legend has it that naked girls used to wrestle there for the favor of the king."

 "Oh? Are you going to entertain me?"

 "For favors?"

 I frowned. Unfairly so. It was my mistake, letting her joke with me before things were settled.

 "I want to see the Spire," I said.

 #

 I had already learned that in the city no one actually sees the Spire: it strains your neck to look up at it. A visitor might do this a few times, but it quickly becomes nothing more than a shadow blocking out the southeastern sky. The only time you really see it is when you are approaching the city. It needs the distance.

 But Anne knew what I meant. She took me back into the city to a pair of stone beasts at the base of the Spire. They guarded the archway of a large tunnel that slanted gently upwards into the rock. It ran for only a few yards before reaching the barrier, a huge gray slab of granite the gypsies had slid into place to seal the Spire.

 Anne pointed at the barrier. "See the holes and tool marks? Every once in a while someone tries to enter the Spire, they chip away at the rock for a week, or a month, and then they give up, you can see that not much progress has been made."

 "So how are you going to get me in?"

 Her hands spread. "I'm trying to tell you that it can't be done."

 My eyes bored into hers. "I can find lots of companies that can't do it."

 Her eyes darkened with intensity behind the hooked nose, but I wouldn't let up. "If you want me, if you want to entertain me for favors, you'll find a way."

 We walked back to the mansion in silence. A challenge was fair. I didn't have to court with her if she wouldn't help me, not if she was like the bios girls. Still, it made me shiver, the way she looked like a hawk ready to strike. 

 CHAPTER 8

 -- STUDENTS

 

 The trouble with school is all the rules. Old Proctor Lagrange sat sternly behind his desk. "Students are expected to behave in a manner fitting their status..."

 The sun drew my eyes to the globe that stood on its pedestal behind the Proctor. They said it was a model of Snowshoe. And it could have been: the light bouncing off the white surface made my eyes squint like they did on a clear winter day. And the blue-green strip around its middle could have been the land.

 Except that they had it all wrong. Anne had shown me the land from the lookout in the Rincons. And it was big. Yet if you believed what they said, the whole of the land was just a tiny spot on the globe. But it couldn't be. How could anything, even a planet, be so much bigger? And how did they expect me to save something that size?

 "You will find the guidance you need in the Book of Rules." Proctor Lagrange pushed a thick tome towards me.

 My eyes flicked to the book. Help with the quest? Oh... He meant school.

 "I expect you here every afternoon until you have finished it."

 Great. Classes in the morning -- free time in the afternoon. They had promised. But Scribbles wanted me in the library researching the Elevator. And Perigee expected us in his room for tea. And now there were rules.

 #

 Like all the rooms at the school, the dinning hall was build on a scale too grand for our small numbers. Tables were arranged around the edges of the room, but they were always empty, we never ate there. Our table stood at the exact center of the hall, surrounded by an expanse of open space.

 And the table itself was too large. A space at the head of the table was reserved for Proctor Lagrange. Instructor React sat at his right; head student Perigee at his left. The other students -- Ellipse, Orbi, Retro, and myself -- were spread along either side of the table. Even so, we left empty space, enough for a half dozen more boys, at the foot of the table.

 On Saturday morning, Professor React announced, "Dinner will be formal tonight. And the girls will be there so I expect you be on your best behavior."

 However, the girls' presence at dinner hardly seemed cause for being on good behavior. They stood shoulder-to-shoulder behind chairs arranged around the tables at the edges of the hall -- except that they had made little gaps between the companies. Rumors said that there had already been fighting as the girls tried to intimidate each other. It wasn't fair that we had to be on good behavior when the girls got to act like ruffians.

 Anne and the other human girls were crowded together at the far end of a table where I could hardly see them. They were too far away to even talk with me. And I wanted to talk. I had not seen them since the previous week when Anne had delivered me to the school. Had Anne found a way into the Spire? Or would I have to recruit another company?

 However, when a servant set the roast on our table, the hot, spicy aroma drew my attention to dinner. My hand twitched in anticipation as I glanced across the table at Retro. If he was slow, I could get one of the juicy slices from the center. But Retro, like the other students, remained standing behind his chair. It seemed odd that no one had started the usual grab for food, but there was there was nothing to do but watch the other boys and follow their lead.

 I had to be careful. If Proctor Lagrange found out I hadn't read the Book of Rules, I would get another lecture. But it wasn't my fault: Professor React was making me catch up to the other students. He kept piling books on my desk and quizzing me about my progress. And of course Ellipse was always there to jump on every little mistake.

 Finally, Proctor Lagrange entered the hall and took his place. He looked briefly around the room, and seemingly satisfied that we were properly assembled, he announced, "Be seated."

 Once the shuffling of chairs ceased, Proctor Lagrange looked down the table to Retro. "Perhaps My Lord, you would be so kind as to pass the roast."

 "Of course My Lord."

 "Thank you My Lord."

 The Proctor took several slices from the center of the roast and passed it to Professor React. Then we all joined in with the Pleases, My Lords, and Thank Yous until our plates were full, but no one sampled their food until Proctor Lagrange picked up his fork and began eating.

 I pushed at my roast with my fork. It was an end piece, burnt and dry. "Is there any gravy left?" I asked.

 #

 After dinner, when we moved into the sitting room for coffee, Ellipse looked over at the knot of girls and complained, "I don't care if she is the Jurist, they shouldn't allow human girls here."

 "They're not so bad," I said. "You just need to get used to them."

 "They're runts," Retro declared.

 I glanced up at him but decided not to argue. Retro, I was sure, had devolved to human form. He was big, bigger than the human girls and only slightly smaller than the bios girls. Black hair curled over his chest and back and a forest grew under his arms. He won arguments by flexing his big muscles and crowding into your face. And he thought it funny to make rude noises. Definitely human.

 However, no one mentioned the human girls again. You knew they were there, but you didn't see them. The bios girls drew your eyes, making the human girls fade into the background.

 The boys and girls stood apart, sipping coffee and talking quietly. I supposed from the way the girls kept glancing at us, that they were talking about us. Probably assessing their prospects, just as Perigee and Orbi were assessing ours.

 I made a game of guessing which girl they were describing. The rich velvet cape of Bekah, captain of the Market company, and the powerful stance of Candace, captain of the Forge company, made them easy enough to pick out. But when Perigee began describing the virtues and deficiencies of the farm girls, I was lost. Hanna or India, Ethyl or Judith, their clean dress, taunt figures, and flawless complexions gave them an equality that was hard to pierce.

 Motion by the windows overlooking the garden drew my attention. Anne was there watching the sun sink below the distant Rincons. How slender and plain she looked. On the trail, she had proved competent enough, but seeing her next to the bios girls made me wonder how she could possibly compete against them.

 My eyes shifted back to the bios girls. Now was the time to find a real company, before they were all taken. I glanced at the boys, who weren't doing anything but talking, and slipped away to join Anne. If she wasn't going to help me, I needed to know.

 Anne turned to smile as I approached. The way her eyes sparkled when she took in my figure made it hard to ask mean questions, not right away anyway.

 So I offered her my hand, and as she shook it, I nodded towards the west and asked, "Wondering about the war?"

 "Yes, but there won't be much action now, not with Mercid bottled up, the troops will want to rush the fort, but Mother knows better -- too many casualties, she'll wait until the bandits are obviously weak or until spring, when the farmers have to get back to the farms, before she attacks."

 The thought of the long winter wait made me shiver. Already, with the sun not yet down, the air was taking on a chill. The next storm would bring snow to the higher mountains. The siege of Fort Rincon would be an ordeal.

 Another voice drew my attention away from the distant mountains. "What have you found out about the Elevator?"

 It was Scribbles come to join us. Tiny, Saratan, and Robyn stood with her.

 "We've got a surprise," Tiny said.

 "A surprise? What?"

 "It's a surprise," Robyn said. Her lip, I noticed then, was puffed up. Had she been fighting? Served her right.

 "We know how to get in," Tiny declared.

 In the Spire? I wanted to ask, but we were interrupted by the sound of another girl clearing her throat.

 It was one of the bios girls. Bekah. I recognized the velvet cape. "Good evening, My Lord. I ask permission to introduce myself."

 She had soft green eyes that held you, but the sudden silence in the sitting room put me on alert. Everyone, it seemed, was watching to see what I would do. Of course. This was part of the contest between the girls. Bekah expected to put the humans in their place by capturing my attention.

 But no -- I owed the girls some loyalty. "Well, you'll have to ask the Jurist. I'm with her."

 The green eyes widened, just a bit, then she bowed slightly. "Another time perhaps."

 "Suit yourself." I shrugged, but she walked away so casually that I wondered whether I had made a mistake. Had I got it wrong about the contest?

 "Let's walk in the garden," Anne suggested.

 "Okay." And it better be a good surprise. Bekah was gorgeous.

 But the girls gave me no time to fret over her. When we reached the garden, Scribbles asked, "What about the Beast? Did you find out anything?"

 "Not yet."

 She was persistent. "We need more information."

 "It's too cold. Let's go back inside."

 #

 At breakfast the next morning, when I reached for the last strip of bacon, Retro grabbed my arm and pinned it to the table. With the other hand, he picked the bacon off the platter and began to casually nibble on it.

 You had to be quick around Retro: he ate everything. So thinking that he was just displaying his usual bad manners, I sighed in surrender. But when I tried to pull my hand away, he held it down. When I looked up, he locked his eyes on mine and spoke, "Keep away from Bekah."

 "It's Gypsy she wants," Ellipse said. "She can't take her eyes off him." He said it with a grin that got wider when Retro tighten his grip on my wrist.

 Orbi tapped his head. "Think Retro. There are two girls, no, two companies, for every boy here. We don't need to fight over them."

 "Keep away from her," Retro repeated. His grip became painfully tight.

 I shrugged. "I've been to Market. Stinks too much from the stockyards. But the food's good there. The best."

 "Really?" His grip relaxed.

 What a human. I wasn't even interested in Bekah. They were just dreams, the ones I had in the night about soft green eyes that followed me.

 #

 I opened a book, scanned its contents, returned it to the shelf, and picked up the next book. Sometimes the humans were more trouble that they were worth. I could already hear Scribbles nagging me. So far I had failed to find any information about the Elevator, but she wouldn't care that I had other things to do. It was hard to find time for searching. And how could I stay focused when presented with strange cryptic diagrams or drawings that showed the insides of a person's body.

 "You're late," Ellipse said as he rushed through the library.

 I hurried after him, but when I reached the classroom, the boys were still standing by their tables.

 "Arithmetic practice today," Professor React announced when he finally arrived. "Add all the numbers from one to hundred. When you're done, put your papers on my table and you can go."

 I sank into my seat. It'll take forever. I straightened the paper on my desk and decided to re-cut the tip of my quill. The library ought to be organized. In Farhaven, a single shelf held all the books, so it made no difference where you put them. But here, hundreds of shelves held thousands of books. All the books about the law should be together. And all the books about farming. And the Elevator. That way it wouldn't take forever to find out things.

 Professor React stopped pacing. I didn't have to look up to see him staring at me: I could feel it. I dipped the quill into the ink.

 "1 + 2 = 3"

 "3 + 3 = 6"

 Professor React resumed pacing and I picked up the rhythm of his footsteps, six-step-plus-step-four-step equals...

 Soon Professor React's footsteps faded away down the hall and the scratching of quills stopped. "How far are you?" I asked Orbie.

 "Eight. You?"

 "Six."

 "Done." Retro was grinning as he rose from his chair, dropped a paper on Professor React's table, and walked out of the classroom.

 Ellipse jumped to his feet and picked up the paper. "He's in trouble," he pronounced.

 #

 Professor React waved the paper. "What is the meaning of this?"

 "Is it not correct?" Retro looked amused.

 He's going to get it. No one messed with Professor React.

 Professor React cleared his throat. "That's not the point. You were supposed to work it out."

 "But I did. In my head."

 Professor React frowned, then pointed at the slate board. "Show us."

 "The numbers don't care which order they are added," Retro said. "So I chose:

 "1 + 100 = 101. And:

 "2 + 99 = 101. And:

 "3 + 98 = 101. In fact all the sums, when done this way, come out to 101.

 "So there are half a hundred sums of 101, giving the answer: fifty hundreds and fifty ones."

 "That's cheating!" Ellipse cried out. "You're supposed to do it the regular way."

 "Who says?"

 We turned to Professor React for a verdict, but he waved an impatient hand at us. "Enough," he snapped.

 He sat for the longest time at his desk, staring at the slate board, drumming his fingers on the table, and looking increasingly unhappy.

 Ellipse began to smirk.

 But when Professor React pronounced his verdict, it was Retro's turn to smirk. "I can find no flaw. You're dismissed Retro."

 Retro winked at us on his way out.

 I stared after him. First Scribbles and now Retro. The humans weren't really smarter than me. They couldn't be. They just didn't think fair was all.

 Professor React fixed his gaze on us. "Have you all finished then?"

 #

 I was glad for the shelter of the city wall. The freezing air out of the north swirled only lightly around the causeway. Still, I pulled my coat tighter about me. Out across the lake, the wind whipped spray into the air as it regained its force. And by the time I reached the gate towers, the wind was pushing against my back and trying to hurry me across the lawn. Winter had arrived.

 The girls were waiting inside the mansion. Saratan braced the door against the wind and let it open just enough for me to slip in. Relief, the sudden warmth of still air as she pushed the door closed behind me, lasted only an instant. The girls were all struggling into their coats.

 "Where we going?" I asked.

 "To the lake," Scribbles said. Her left eye was bruised and swollen nearly shut.

 "What happened?"

 "Just a tussle, did you find anything yet?"

 No, but I was saved from answering by wind roaring into the hall as Saratan opened the door again. "Come on," she shouted.

 "This better be a good surprise," I shouted back as I hurried after her. Better the cold than explaining my poor effort in the library.

 Well, maybe not. The icy wind, which had hardly been bearable when I was moving downwind, now blew right into my face. I ducked my head and tried to follow Saratan's feet across the lawn. But it was hard to see with my head down and eyes almost shut, so I lost her before reaching the causeway. I looked up to see her waiting in the shelter of the restored gate tower.

 Saratan waited only long enough for us to reach the tower, then she led us down stone steps to the water's edge to where several flat- bottomed skiffs were tied up to a stone dock. A stone wall sheltered the dock from the wind, so the skiffs bobbed gently in the water. Nonetheless, Saratan knelt down and grabbed the bow of a skiff and Anne grabbed the stern. "Get in the middle," Anne ordered.

 But I knew enough to keep my weight centered, so I rocked the skiff a lot less than they did when they followed me aboard. When Tiny, Scribbles, and Robyn were safely aboard the other skiff, Saratan pushed us away from the dock and the girls paddled us past the stone wall and into the choppy waters of the lake. Fortunately the chop was too low to come over the sides of the skiff, but the wind blew spay into my face, so I ducked down behind Saratan's shoulders and let the girls worry about where we were going.

 After a while, Anne leaned forward and spoke into my ear. "Look, you see where the Spire interrupts the Wall?"

 I looked up and followed her finger. On the lakeside of the city, the Wall followed the shoreline until it butted into the Spire. The Spire itself, an unscaleable barrier that leapt straight up from the deep lake waters, was all the protection the city needed.

 "Now look at the Spire." Her finger continued to guide my eyes. "In the middle there, level with the top of the wall, do you see that dark spot?"

 "Yes." Well maybe. The wind and spray made it hard to see anything clearly. "Is it an opening?"

 "I'm sure of it."

 "But how will we reach it?" The dark spot was a good thirty feet above the lake.

 "We'll drop ropes from both ends of the wall and use a boat to tie the ends together, when we pull the ropes back up, we'll have a rope bridge to the window."

 "Are we going now?"

 "Tomorrow or the next day, when the wind dies down, and we need training, you'll have to stay this afternoon for practice."

 #

 The girls dug in with their paddles and we scooted downwind to the island. Even so, I kept my face buried in Saratan's back until the sudden fading of the wind signaled our arrival in the shelter of the dock.

 I didn't need help getting out of the skiff, but Anne took my arm anyway. "Come with me," she said.

 Anne guided me up the steps to the base of the gate tower and pointed to a rope strung tight against the surface of the tower. It was suspended waist-high above a narrow ledge that ran out over the steps we had just climbed. The ledge and rope disappeared behind the curve of the tower, but I could guess that they led out over the water.

 "What's this?" I asked, but I thought I knew.

 Anne pulled the rope away from the tower. "Get under the rope and see if you can go out on the ledge."

 I was right. Anne's idea of a bridge was a single strand of rope. Worse, I wasn't even allowed to walk on it. But I did as she said.

 It was not so bad. The ledge allowed my toes to support my weight, and the rope pushed against my back to keep me against the tower. Unfortunately, my hands could find nothing to grip. To move, I had to push out slightly with my hands, inch my body over a bit, and let the rope balance me while I adjusted my feet.

 Movement, however, became scary as I inched out onto the ledge. I kept looking down to see the steps dropping farther and father below me. All to soon I was suspended a dozen or more feet above the stones.

 When I reached the top of the wall sheltering the dock, the sound of a voice drew my eyes back to the girls. Anne was shouting something. "Be careful... wind...back."

 Be careful in the wind. I knew that. I turned and squinted into it. The rope was tied off on a projection only twenty feet around the curve of the tower. I could make that.

 But as I worked my way beyond the wall I looked down to see the lake waters slapping against the base of the tower. And the wind began pushing and pulling at me.

 I forced my eyes off the water and pressed my forehead against the stone. Maybe I should go back. No. The girls won't take me if I can't do it.

 Then suddenly, I'm not sure how, I was sliding downwards. The tower stones offered nothing for my hands, but as the rope slid up my back and over my shoulders, I grabbed for it. But it was awkward, grabbing something behind you -- only my left hand caught. And I had it only by the tips of my fingers. As my weight pulled the rope tight it jerked away from me and I fell into the water.

 #

 The hard part was convincing Anne that I wouldn't fall from the Spire. "It was the wind that blew me off," I told her.

 "The water under the Spire is deep," she said. "You won't be able to wade ashore."

 "We have to have a boat anyway -- for the rope. It can just wait, in case anyone does fall." I didn't mention my real thoughts. What with the shock of cold water, and the weight of winter clothes, anyone falling into the water would go straight to the bottom. Even after the girls had gotten me dried and sitting by the fire, I was still shivering. And if the water had been over my head...

 #

 The following afternoon, when I walked to the island, cloudy skies threatened rain or perhaps snow. But the wind had died down and the air seemed warmer.

 I found the girls at the base of the gate tower. They were laying out heavy looking packs near the rope bridge. When they turned to greet me, I noticed a bright red bruise on Anne's cheek.

 "More fighting?" I asked.

 She shrugged. "A bit, are you ready to try the crossing again?"

 I imitated her shrug. "Sure. Let's do it."

 She stared hard at me for a moment. But I remembered another time -- the time after the bandit attack when Saratan wanted to return me to Farhaven. So I returned Anne's stare, and after a moment, she nodded.

 "All right," she announced to the girls, "from now on, we will run every practice exactly like the real crossing, Robyn you go first."

 "Saratan should go first," I objected.

 The girls looked blankly at me. I looked right back at them. "Robyn always gets the best jobs."

 "A company can only have one captain." Anne's voice seemed too soft. And the stare had returned.

 "But... Well, I was just saying..." I looked at the Tower.

 Anne left a moment of silence, just to make sure I got the point, then she bent to pick up a pack. "Robyn, you're first."

 All the girls picked up packs -- except for Robyn. The captain's pet, was too good to carry anything. She slipped under the rope and scooted quickly along the ledge. A few moments after she disappeared around the curve of the tower, the rope twitched, signaling for the next girl.

 That was Anne. As she stepped onto the ledge, Tiny steadied her and adjusted the rope so that it pressed across the middle of the heavy backpack. Anne pushed out from the wall to test her balance and nodded to Tiny. Unlike Robyn's scamper, Anne's motion was deliberate, but even so, she was soon out of sight.

 As Tiny helped Saratan, then Scribbles, onto the ledge, I began wondering about the half-dozen packs left lying on the ground. How were we going to get them across? The mystery was solved when Anne, Scribbles, and Saratan came back. They each made two more trips to ferry the packs across.

 Finally only Tiny and myself remained. I let her help me onto the ledge and under the rope. "Don't look down," she said.

 There was just the one bad moment, when I crossed over the wall and out over the water. I couldn't help thinking about yesterday's fall into the icy lake, but I kept my eyes fixed on the rope and soon Robyn was pulling me into a window.

 The girls were all inside the tower sitting on their packs. We waited with Tiny arrived at the window, then Anne stood and said, "Good, now let's go back."

 I didn't say anything, but as Robyn disappeared out the window, I leaned back and looked at the open door to our room. We could have just walked out of the tower.

 #

 That'll teach me, I thought as I slowly climbed the steps at the University. If I hadn't fallen into the water, Anne might have been satisfied with the one practice crossing. But instead, she had made us cross and return two more times. Not that it was hard, but the long, boring waits, broken by intervals of extreme tension while I clung to the little ledge, had sapped my energy.

 Worse, Anne hadn't agreed that we could go. Scribbles wouldn't shut up about the Beast -- kept saying we needed more information. I would have to find something tonight. We were to meet again tomorrow, and Anne would make her decision.

 Maybe the kitchen will have coffee, I was thinking, but I never got that far. The instant I entered the common room, Ellipse jumped up and waved a parchment sheet at me.

 "It's a warrant," he declared. "You're to arrest the Jurist and bring her to the Student Court." 

 CHAPTER 9

 -- BEASTS

 

 The trouble with plans is that they don't work out. It all started with the warrant, which threatened to wreck the expedition before it began.

 In the student court, the head student acts as judge and the other boys are examiners and jurors. So the next morning, Perigee assembled us in the hall outside the common room and handed Retro the Staff of Law. "Call the court to order."

 The mahogany staff seemed suited to Retro. It was tall, taller than Retro, and elaborately carved except at the center where a smooth band served as a grip. Retro briefly tested its weight, then marched into the common room. Bang, bang, bang, he struck the staff on the floor. "Be silent," his voice boomed out. "The court begins."

 Well, he can always find work as a bailiff. I lowered myself into my seat and looked around the common room. It had been rearranged to provide a table for us to sit behind, and the couches and other chairs had been moved about so the instructors, captains, and visitors could sit before us. India and Anne sat somewhat apart, in front of all the others.

 Perigee began. "You have a petition for the court?" he asked India.

 India rose, and despite swollen lips that blurred her reply, glared righteously towards Anne. "Jurist Anne has no regard for the rules of conduct, no sense of fair play.

 "I caught one of the humans creeping about the streets where she had no business. When I gave chase, the little sneak led me into an alley where the rest of them ambushed me."

 "So you're seeking the protection of the court?" I asked.

 The banging of the staff came too quickly for Retro to have gotten a signal from Perigee. But when Perigee raised his hand for silence, it was me he rebuked. "Be quiet Gypsy. You'll get your turn."

 "I was just asking if she wanted help."

 "Silence."

 I shrugged and stared at India. She knew, everyone knew, that she should have fought it out privately with Anne.

 Perigee nodded to India. "You may continue."

 "It's justice I seek." India stood very straight, but I had seen her glance towards Ellipse. It was plain that he was the true source of the complaint.

 When Perigee let Anne speak, she spoke frankly. "We seek no trouble. But if it's a fight someone wants, it's a fight they'll get."

 Ellipse was waving his hand even before Anne sat down. "The rules are clear. The girls are required to fight one-on-one. And given that the Jurist is unrepentant, she should be dismissed from school."

 When Perigee let me speak, I looked at Ellipse. "Let's see, you think it's okay for your girls to pick a fight with a someone half their size, but not okay for the smaller girls to defend themselves. Is that it?"

 "I think," he said, "that if the humans can't follow the rules, they don't belong here."

 The banging of Retro's staff prevented further bickering. Perigee asked if we had any evidence to offer, and when we didn't, he allowed us only a final statement.

 Ellipse was adamant in his conclusion. "Despite Gypsy's attempt to confuse the issue, this case is clear. The humans have violated the rules and their company should be disbanded."

 Confusing the issue seemed my best plan. I tried to appeal to a larger sense of justice. "I wonder whether it's right to use rules to enforce an unfair advantage. In any case, the girls are a company. They should fight together."

 #

 "There's going to be trouble," Scribbles declared, but she kept feeding the rope over the edge.

 "No," I said. I had to stand on my toes to look beyond her. The rope floated on the water as it trailed behind the skiff. "I told you, Perigee said you girls can't come to school for a week. He didn't say nothing about taking me on expedition."

 "There's still the Beast, we don't know anything."

 "They got it," someone in the crowd announced. Itty and Bitty had finally reached the far side of the Spire and caught the rope dangling from the other wall.

 We hadn't told anybody about the expedition, but we were seen carrying gear to the base of the spire, and soon a curious crowd gathered to watch -- and to comment on every little delay.

 But the bridge building could not be rushed. The gap where the Spire interrupted the wall was a hundred yards wide, a long span for any rope. To make the bridge, the girls had braided together smaller ropes until we had a strand that was thicker than my wrist and so heavy it had to be hauled in a wagon.

 Now, after Mother hauled the far end of the rope out of the water and signaled that she had tied it off, I found myself wishing that the storm hadn't blown itself out. Bad weather might have kept the crowd away.

 "Try flipping it...

 "They'll never do it...

 "What are they doing now?"

 The rope was stuck. At first, when the girls began pulling it in, it came up easily. But when the slack was gone, tension forced it tight against the curve of the Spire. Soon it caught against an outcropping of rough rock and refused to budge. A couple of bios girls from the crowd offered to help pull, but even they could not dislodge the rope.

 Anne ordered the rope lowered back to the water and had Itty and Bitty attach a guideline, row out into the lake, and anchor the skiff. When we hauled the rope back up, they used the guideline to pull the rope away from the Spire and over the outcropping.

 Unfortunately, the girls were not able to pull the rope completely straight. The harder they pulled, the tighter it gripped the face of the Spire. Eventually they reached a point where no amount of jerking on the rope or the guideline could produce any progress.

 "I'll get it," Robyn said. She slipped under the rope and began working her way along the ledge, pulling the rope up as she went.

 "Keep it tight," Anne reminded the other girls, but she needn't have. Saratan and Tiny were working together to keep the rope cinched around a rock so it couldn't slip backwards. And Anne herself was helping Scribbles pull in the slack as Robyn straightened the rope.

 I expected Robyn to stop when she reached the opening, but instead she kept on going for another dozen yards or so. Only when the entire length of rope was above the ledge, did she return to the opening and disappear inside.

 She was gone forever, but when she did reappear, she waved for us to come over. We were in.

 #

 "Okay, just like practice, feel your way along, and don't look down," Tiny said.

 But I did look down. At one spot near the end, the ledge was so narrow that I was supported by only my toes. I looked to make sure of my footing and my eyes were drawn straight down the wall to the water below. It was too far. I was going to fall.

 I pulled my eyes up from the water and started to lay my forehead against the rock. But no. That was how I fell before. I fixed my eyes to the side -- on the rope -- and made myself stay aware of the rope, the ledge, and the rock. No sliding down this time.

 I waited. Moments passed and nothing happened. I moved my hand. Yes, I had my balance. Slowly I inched forward past the bad spot. And then Robyn's arms pulled me into the opening.

 #

 We were in a tight tunnel made even smaller by stacks of equipment strewn along its length. In the far distance I could see the dim flickering of a torch. Robyn sent me down the tunnel while she waited for Tiny. The ceiling was too low to walk upright, but not so low that I was forced to crawl, so I moved along navigating around the gear in an awkward crouch.

 I met Scribbles. She was picking up gear, transferring it down the tunnel. "Wait until you see it," she said.

 "See what?"

 "You'll see." She picked up a pack and led me inwards.

 #

 The tunnel ended on a ledge overlooking a vast chamber. From high above, shafts of light streaked down, illuminating a frozen ceremony. In the center of the floor, a mechanical spread its wings in a landing flare. A group of six women formed an arc around the landing zone. And looming behind and over them was a beast. It sat on its haunches with a clawed arm extended as if to direct events.

 Scribbles lowered me to the chamber floor and I walked among the statues. I knew that the mechanical was not real; still, memories of their abrupt landings kept me clear of the landing zone. The statues of the women were all bios -- no humans, and no boys. As I brushed past, their stone skin felt slick and cold under my fingers.

 I stopped before the beast. Its face -- wide eyes, flat nose, and wicked fangs -- matched the face on my Beast Card. But the card gave no indication of its size. Sitting, it was over ten feet tall, and the powerful legs and arms bulged with muscles larger than my whole body.

 Anne came up behind me. "What do you make of it?"

 "If we meet one, I'm running."

 Still it made you wonder. Wonder about children's stories of an empire where beasts ruled the stars, mechanicals were pilots, and humans were workers.

 #

 "There's more to see," Anne said and led me away from the statues into the shadows. She lit a torch and we followed a large tunnel for about a hundred yards into the rock. When it abruptly stopped, blocked by an enormous granite slab, she handed me the torch. Cupping her hands for my foot, she boosted me up so I could peer over the top of the slab.

 The slab was covered with debris, rusted gears and wheels, an assortment of twisted iron bars, and tangled loops of rope that seemed to be made of metal strands. It all seemed to have fallen from a shaft rising above the slab.

 "We think it's the slab that blocks the entrance," she said. "Can you see the tracks on the side? They must have been used to guide it into place."

 "Yes. And this stuff up here must have been for lifting it back up. Too bad it's all fallen down."

 #

 We returned to the mechanical and found the girls. They had moved our packs to the bottom of steps that spilled out from a tunnel. When I peered up into the blackness, I could see the steps leading up into the rock.

 "Saratan, you and Robyn lead off," Anne said. "Scribbles and Tiny bring up the rear."

 I snatched up my pack and started up the steps behind Robyn, not giving Anne a chance to stick me where I couldn't see what was going on. But all I could see past Robyn's rear was a never changing series of steps flickering in the pool of yellow light from Saratan's torch. With Saratan in the lead, we were going to move at caravan pace and no faster, so I got off Robyn's heels.

 We settled into the steady trudge upwards until a flat landing interrupted the steps. Light from a short side tunnel chased away the darkness and led us to a window overlooking the city. About once an hour we came to these windows, each of which looked out in a different direction. Apparently the steps spiraled up around the outside surface of the Spire.

 We stopped at each of the windows. At first we merely wanted to take in the view, but all too soon we needed the rest. The never-ending steps cruelly introduced a killing ache into our leg muscles. Eventually towards evening, after our fifth or sixth stop, I tried to stand, but my muscles cramped, and I collapsed in pain.

 "We'll camp here," Anne said. So while Scribbles rolled me over and massaged my legs, the other girls set up camp. They rolled out our sleeping pads in the narrow tunnel and handed out jerky for supper.

 "This is fun," I said between chews. "I forgot how much I like sleeping on hard ground with smelly girls."

 "Oh," Saratan countered. "We'll just see who wants to cuddle in the night."

 "Well I'm not waiting until I'm cold." I forced my way in between Scribbles and Tiny, and we shifted around to find comfortable positions.

 The girls were tired too, and as they settled, the tunnel became quiet. As I lay against Scribbles' back I could feel her breathing, but the only sound was the faint rasp of Tiny's breath near my ear.

 "What's that sound?" I asked.

 "What sound?"

 "Hush."

 We listened to the silence.

 "Maybe it's the Beast."

 "I don't hear anything."

 "Good thing we got lots of girls -- in case it needs a snack."

 "Boys are easier to chew."

 "We had better post a guard," Anne decided. "Robyn, you're the first watch."

 It really is fun, I thought.

 #

 The dawn light made us stir from our sleep, but the cold air kept us huddled together until Anne ordered us up. When Tiny, then Scribbles, abandoned me to the cold, I joined in the chorus of groans as we stretched out sore legs. Lacking wood for a fire, we downed bread and water for breakfast, gathered our packs, and started up the stairs.

 I could hardly keep up at first. But caravan pace has its logic. Soon my muscles warmed, and I stopped shivering. And a short time later my legs loosened, letting me join the girls in the upward rhythm.

 Suddenly I bumped into Tiny's pack. She was stopped, and when I looked past her, I could see Scribbles stopped as well. Ahead of them, Anne stood in bright daylight talking to Robyn.

 "What's happening?" I asked.

 "Don't know."

 "Law! I knew I should have been up front." I pushed on Tiny, who in turn pushed on Scribbles, and we crowded forward.

 "Stay back," Anne ordered when she saw us. "The tunnel's broke out into the open, we'll have to rig a rope."

 "What's she mean?"

 "Don't know."

 We saw Robyn drop her pack and Saratan tie a rope around Robyn's waist. Then she went forward and disappeared. Saratan held onto the rope and Anne helped her play it out behind Robyn. The way they were braced, it looked like they were expecting Robyn to fall.

 After a while, Anne called Scribbles forward and sent her ahead carrying Robyn's pack. Finally, after Tiny too had disappeared upwards, I was allowed to move forward.

 As I stepped into the daylight, I saw the problem. The steps continued into the open space beyond the tunnel exit. Chiseled out of the native rock, they formed a narrow ledge that hugged the side of the Spire thousands of feet above the lake below.

 "Go ahead." Anne said.

 I didn't move.

 "What's wrong?"

 "I froze on the ledge," I admitted.

 "There's more room here."

 "It's higher. A lot."

 Anne signaled Saratan to stay clear then stood silent. I looked to Saratan, but she was intently picking at the ends of the rope. They wouldn't make me do it, but their silence made it plain what they would think if I didn't.

 I gripped the safety rope and tried to focus my attention upwards. The steps were wide -- four feet at least. In the city, a safety rope would be embarrassing, but I was glad to have it. I used it to pull myself forward, overcoming the inertia in my legs. And this time I knew better than to look down. I kept my eyes focused on Robyn all the way.

 I joined the girls and looked about. Blue sky all around. We were at the top.

 #

 Nature, or someone, had cut the Spire off level then gouged the surface. From our position at the head of the steps, we looked out over a deeply fissured landscape of gray rock. We could see no building or landmarks, only a narrow path that slopped down from the steps and disappeared into a crevice.

 We waited for Anne to join us. When Robyn began reeling in the rope, I knew that Saratan was at the far end, coming up the steps without a rail. I looked away, to the east.

 Because the top of the Spire was higher than the Escarpment, I was able to look down on the eastern plain. Except for a handful of protuberances, it could have been a smooth brown ocean sweeping the horizon from north to south. To the east, the gentle waves of the Red Hills rolled towards the Elevator. Southeast, twin spikes of rock, called the Horns, erupted from the plain. Behind them, a distant mountain range broke the horizon.

 Below the Horns, a diagonal gash in the Escarpment, the Staircase, ran down to the swamp. The huge blanket of yellow-green pools guarded the Escarpment from the lake where, directly below, reflected images of clouds slid across the mirror surface.

 "That was scary," Saratan announced when she reached us. Her eyes shined as they swept in the sights.

 #

 "Let's go," Anne said with a motion to Saratan who led off down the path. Robyn beat me to the next spot, but I slipped in behind her.

 On both sides of the crevice, vertical rock faces rose above our heads, confining us to the shoulder wide path as we crunched over a gravel surface. Even the noise of our passage was trapped within the walls.

 "Hey." I bumped into Robyn.

 "Which way?" Saratan was asking.

 I pushed Robyn ahead until I could see paths leading off to the left, right, and ahead. Each corridor wound around rock facings that blocked our view after a few yards. Nothing gave a hint as to the proper direction.

 "Go straight," Anne decided when she saw the situation. "We can always explore the other trails later."

 "Ha," I said to Robyn as I stole her place behind Saratan.

 But nothing came of my hopes to be in on the next discovery. Saratan made good time: whenever the path branched or crossed another path, she chose whichever direction seemed straightest and pressed on without stopping. But for all our progress, the time passed without result.

 Finally I complained, "When are we going to get there? I'm hungry."

 Anne called a halt at the next intersection. It lacked room for a proper camp, but we made sitting space by spreading out down the paths. Lunch -- jerky and a sip of water -- was hardly worth the effort.

 "Something's wrong," Anne said. "The Spire's not that big. We should have gotten someplace by now."

 "Come on, Robyn," Saratan said as she pulled Tiny to her feet. "Let's lift her up for a look." Using the rock for balance and Robyn's back for a step, Tiny climbed to stand on Saratan's shoulders.

 "What do you see?" Anne asked.

 "Nothing. Just rock."

 "How far are we from the edge?"

 "It's right there." Tiny swiveled around and pointed down one of the side paths.

 "Stay put," Anne ordered, but she was too late: Robyn and I were already rushing down the path.

 Robyn tried to pull up when she heard the order, but her momentum and my pushing carried her around a little bend. "It's right here," she shouted.

 The crevice opened onto a wide ledge that looked out over the land. A chocolate mound, Haystack mountain, was off to our left; a black scar, the Escarpment, to our right. We were on the northern rim of the Spire.

 #

 "I think we're lost," Scribbles announced.

 "No kidding."

 "It's not that bad," Anne said. She sat on the ledge and scooped pebbles into a circle. "Look, here's the edge of the Spire. Somehow we've gotten on a path that runs just inside the edge. All we have to do is head east and check all the paths leading to the left. One of them will lead us back to the steps."

 "Good thinking." Scribbles snorted. "Except we're supposed to be looking for the Beast."

 "So we take paths to the right."

 "You're just guessing," Scribbles said.

 Anne nodded in agreement. "We'll return to the steps. If we make it, we won't be guessing, we'll know."

 #

 A half-hour later we were back at the steps. Anne gave us no chance to argue over how to proceed. "Pile all the extra gear on top of that rock," she ordered.

 Her idea was to make a marker that we could use to check our position. The pile of torches, water and food for the decent, and spare rope extended the height of the rock enough, she hoped, to be visible from anywhere in the maze.

 "Ok let's go." Anne nodded at Saratan, sending her off down the path again. But when I tried to follow, Anne snagged my shirt and pulled me aside.

 "Hey," I complained. She responded by grabbing Robyn and holding us. Tiny and Scribbles filed by.

 "I've got a job for you two. Make piles of pebbles to mark our path." Then she was off down the path leaving us to bring up the rear.

 At every intersection, Anne called a stop. Crowding Scribbles did no good: she couldn't see either. We could hear Tiny calling out directions, but we couldn't see her pointing. When the girls started moving again, Robyn and I scooped up pebbles into a line marking our path through the intersection. Then we scurried after the others, catching up in time to wait at the next intersection.

 #

 After the first few intersections Robyn and I realized that hurrying only extended the wait at the next intersection. We began to dally a bit, and so, when the company found the Beast's lair, we missed out on the discovery.

 We had made our mark and gotten only a few dozen yards down the path when the crevice opened up overlooking a circular depression. We looked out over a tangled forest. The unruly trees filled the depression except in the center, where the white dome of a structure broke through their olive canopy, and to the right, where they gave way to the blue waters of a small lake.

 Steps led down from the crevice to where Scribbles and Tiny were just disappearing into the forest. We rushed after them. At the bottom a rough trail led into the trees. At one time, it had been neatly paved, but tree roots had pushed up the paving stones leaving moss filled cracks for us to step over.

 I didn't like the forest. The path was too dark and the trees too twisted. I grabbed Robyn's blouse and wouldn't let her pull away from me until we reached the lake and found the other girls.

 We dropped our packs with theirs, and joined them before an opening set in the side of a stone building. Anne and Saratan were pushing at a door that seemed to be stuck closed.

 "You might not want to open that," I said.

 "Why not?"

 "Look." I extracted a card from my deck and showed it to the girls. It depicted the elaborately drawn face of a beast. The same face was carved into the door. "This is the Beast," I said. "It is the symbol of power and knowledge. And danger."

 "You can't scare us with your gypsy stories," Robyn declared. "We're not children." But her eyes were busy switching between the card and door.

 "We will set up camp and have a look around first," Anne decided. She sent Robyn off with Saratan to scout the depression. Scribbles got busy laying out the camp and Tiny gathered firewood for cooking.

 Anne and I walked around the building but found only walls of bleached stone. And the explorers returned convinced that the depression held only this one building with its single entrance.

 "It doesn't matter," Robyn declared. "Even if the Beast is behind the door, we have to open it. Either that or we can give up and go home."

 Anne nodded agreement and sent the girls back to the door. But they were unable to find a latch. Robyn did find a small slot in the center of the door and probed it with her knife, but nothing happened. That inspired them to probe all around the edges of the door, but again without result.

 Finally Anne decided to force the door. The girls got a log and tried to batter it open, but the log splintered and cracked. The door never budged.

 #

 Scribbles called us to supper, hot soup simmering in our one pot. We let her ladle it into our bowls and took the bread she offered.

 "This is a treat," Tiny said. She was wiping her bowl clean with the last of her bread.

 "We'll never get in," Scribbles said.

 "Can I have that?"

 Scribbles shrugged and gave Tiny her half finished meal.

 "Maybe this isn't the right place," Robyn said. "We didn't try all the paths."

 Scribbles shook her head. "No room. There's just the maze on the outside and this one crater in the center."

 "You're going to make yourself sick," Saratan warned.

 Tiny who had just cleaned up Scribbles' bowl was rubbing her full little stomach. "Maybe we should try the mechanicals' dive."

 "Mechanical what?"

 Tiny explained that the Farhaven mechanicals used an underwater passage that led from the lake into their service bay. She took us around to the side of the building to where the lake waters lapped against it. We could see that the stone wall continued straight down under the water to where, about ten feet under the surface, a large dark oval marked an underwater entrance.

 "Well maybe a mechanical could get through there," I said, "but we'll freeze if we go in the water." I was remembering my struggle for breath in the cold waters of the harbor.

 "But it's not cold. Feel it."

 When we bent down and dipped our hands in the water, it was cool but not icy.

 "Look." Tiny pointed with her finger across the lake to where a thin mist of steam sat over the water. "It's a hot spring, feeding the lake."

 "I'll go," Robyn said when we returned our attention to the dive hole.

 "No." Anne was firm. "Saratan, what do you think?"

 "Easy enough to get down and up. But if there's no air on the other side, I'll be hard pressed to make it back."

 "Up to you."

 "I'll go."

 "Come straight back. I don't want you in there alone."

 Saratan slipped off her sandals and sword belt and moved to the edge of the water. She hesitated a moment to glance between the water and me then stripped off her heavy clothes and dove in. She went straight down, using powerful sweeps of legs and arms to drive herself through the hole.

 "I'm going after her," Robyn declared the instant she disappeared.

 Anne let her strip but grabbed her arm when she moved to the water. "Wait," she commanded.

 "Look."

 Saratan reappeared and kicked her way to the surface where she broke the water gasping for air. "It's weird," she said between breaths. "The place is on fire."

 #

 When Anne sent Robyn and Saratan back into the building with instructions to open the door, Tiny and I rushed around the building to the entrance. Eventually Anne brought Scribbles around and we waited together.

 After a while the door groaned and rumbled back from the entrance. Anne handed towels to the half naked girls, but I hardly noticed as they slipped past me.

 I peered into a darken room, seeing why Saratan said it was on fire. Rows of tall box-like cabinets were outlined in a dim red glow that emulated from tiny lights scattered across the front of each cabinet.

 We followed an aisle that led to a clearing in the center of the room where the cabinets gave way to a flat, table-like slab. Another aisle led to the pool that connected to the lake. But we could find no other exits or any sign of the Beast.

 Eventually, I joined Scribbles who was closely examining a cabinet. They were about the size of a wardrobe and we could see the outline of doors on their unlighted sides. The fronts were covered with small rectangular tiles, many of which had the glowing red lights. They were like the glowing embers from a fire; except when I touched them, I felt no heat.

 "Let's open up the doors," Robyn suggested as she walked around to the back of the cabinet.

 "Hey," Scribbles warned. "You don't know what's in there. What if we let out a beast or something?"

 "No room," Robyn answered. She pointed to a cabinet near the table. One of its front tiles was missing, allowing us to see that the adjoining tiles were really boxes that extended almost to the rear of the cabinets. And when Robyn found a button that popped inwards to release the doors, we found the remaining space filled with rope-like strands. They connected to the little boxes and ran down into the floor.

 Above us the dome reflected the reddish glow. No doubt the cabinets once had purpose, but now they served only to stand silent guard over an empty lair. The Beast was not at home. 

 CHAPTER 10

 -- SUITORS

 

 The trouble with girls is that you owe them something after they help you. Even though the Spire expedition had failed, Anne had earned the right to take me to the Captain's Ball.

 She had done everything I asked. The Beast should have been there. Or something. Or there should have been another place. To her credit, she had persisted until a lack of supplies forced us out of the Spire.

 Still, as we stepped into the ballroom, party laughter drew my eyes to the other couples. The best girls were taken. Well, Ellipse could have India, and Judith suited Perigee. But Candace was letting Orbie lead her around. And Bekah stood next to Retro, laughing at some buffoonish prank and seemingly unaware of his hand resting on her hip.

 I looked away and spotted Hanna and Ethyl by the punch bowls talking to another girl. She had her back to me, but I recognized her long blonde hair. "Come on," I told Anne, "it's Littlewolf. She's back from the war."

 When Hanna's eyes fixed on my approach, Littlewolf took notice and turned towards me. Her fresh scrubbed smile and clear eyes were an improvement from Fort Rincon, but a sling still supported her left arm.

 I shook her hand. "You're better, I hope."

 "Much. Thank you."

 "Come, we'll have a toast," Hanna offered. She began ladling out punch from a bowl at the rear of the table. "My own special creation," she explained.

 "To victory," Anne proposed as we clanked our goblets together.

 "To adventure," Littlewolf answered.

 I grimaced at the bitter taste -- Hanna had laced the punch with strong wine -- and drank only a small slip, but the two rivals locked eyes, tipping their goblets back and gulping at the punch until the goblets were drained.

 "And how goes the war," Anne asked.

 "Bogged down. The Justice General is opposed to unnecessary risks. You're lucky, I think, that no ill came of your misadventure in the Spire."

 Hanna took my arm. "This is my chance," she whispered into my ear. "I'll steal the boy while those two are flexing muscles." She pulled me towards the dance floor and waltzed me through big sweeping turns that left me breathless.

 The wine, I found, was not so bad once you became used to it. I drank some more and let Ethyl have a dance.

 "We should go to our table now," Anne said when Ethyl returned me.

 "No. I like Hanna's punch. Let's stay and dance."

 #

 Orbie snatched the book from my desk.

 "Give it back."

 "Come on," he said, slipping away around a table where I couldn't reach him. "We're going sledding."

 "I'm busy."

 "You've been saying that for weeks."

 "The book." I held out my hand.

 With a sigh he surrendered it. "We'll be on the hill."

 When he was gone I sat down, but the book remained unopened. The fruitless weeks spent searching through the library had left me drained of energy.

 I had found accounts written in the years immediately after the gypsies had left Towerhold. But they seemed nothing more than questionable and often conflicting collections of rumors: the gypsies had locked the Beast into the Spire; they took the Beast with them; they had hidden the Beast; they had sent the Beast off with Tower Mech; there never had been a Beast.

 Other references added to my confusion. They had taken the keys -- but where were the locks? They had hidden the memory -- you could forget a memory, but hide it? I could make no sense of it.

 Orbie was right: I needed a break. Collecting coat and boots from my quarters, I went out into the snow-covered streets and made my way towards the hill.

 In the northern part of the city, the ground rose gently up to a peak and then, on one short street, fell rapidly away to the base of the wall. When snow fell, the hill became a playground for the boys. Girls came there too, but not to ride. Their job was to carry the sleds back up the hill.

 When I reached the hill, I found a spot, someone's porch, where I could look down the hill and watch the sledders. The sleds were nothing more than planks with upturned noses. A boy would sit behind the nose, someone would give him a push, and down he'd go. Flat ground at the bottom slowed the sleds just enough to keep the boys from getting hurt when they slammed into the hay bundles that lined the base of the wall. A crowd of girls at the bottom took turns helping the boys to their feet and carrying their sleds back to the top.

 Littlewolf approached me holding a sled. Cold and exertion had reddened her cheeks. "Want to ride?"

 "All right." I got off the porch and let her put me onto the sled. As she pushed me towards the edge, I looked down. The slope seemed too steep; the little flat at the bottom, too small; the yellow line of straw, too thin; and the rock wall, too black.

 "I'd like to see you later," Littlewolf said, but the speed of the sled left no time for a reply. It rushed down the hill, skidded across the flat, and dumped me into the hay.

 "Are you okay?" Someone's hand pulled me to my feet.

 "That was crazy," I said.

 The hand belonged to Candace. She picked up the sled while I brushed snow from my trousers.

 "Aren't you with Orbie?"

 "Wish. He's taken up with Hannah."

 We started climbing the hill, meeting Littlewolf part way up. "See you at the bottom," she said to me as we passed.

 #

 "Enough," I said after the sled dumped me into the hay again. "I'm cold."

 "Let's go to the Gatekeeper's Inn," Littlewolf offered. "They have a fire. And hot coffee."

 "All right. But let's wait for Candace."

 At the Gatekeeper's Inn, all the spaces by the fire were taken, but that left us our choice of tables away from the crowd. I sat down while the girls fetched coffee.

 When they were seated, Candace was direct. "Are you not seeing Anne then?"

 "I've been busy." I had not, in fact, seen Anne since the debacle at the Captain's Ball.

 "What are you doing in the library?" Littlewolf asked. "You're there all the time. No one sees you anymore."

 "I've got to figure out what to do with the Elevator."

 "After the Spire?" Littlewolf sounded indignant. "There's nothing to do. And no point in scaring people anymore."

 "What do you think?" I asked Candace.

 Her voice was softer. "There are other things. Choosing a company. Starting a family."

 "So what are your plans? What is your company like?" I asked Candace.

 I let her talk. Candace was from Forge and had plans to start stripping iron from the newly discovered ruins of an ancient city.

 "Did you stop at Forge?" Candace asked. When I looked blankly at her, she added, "On your way here. Did you stop?"

 "Yes. A smoky place." I remembered gray ash you had to brush from chairs and brown air that made you cough.

 "It's the heart of the land. Things happen there."

 "And what of here?" Littlewolf asked. "Will we see more of you now?"

 I sighed. "I suppose. But I still have to study for examination."

 Later when we finished our coffee, I let the girls walk me back to the school.

 #

 After lunch that day, I again put on my boots and coat and went outside. Another storm had arrived, sending a cold icy wind to chase me across the island causeway and into the mansion. The wind blew the door open and fought against me as I shut it out.

 As the door closed, the howling of the wind gave way to excited shouts coming from the king's quarters. Shedding my wraps in the empty entrance, I went down the hall to investigate. Saratan and Robyn were wrestling in the sandpit. The other girls were circled around them, shouting encouragement and instructions.

 Unnoticed, I slipped around and sat on the throne. The girls noticed me then and stopped their shouting to stare at me. The sudden silence distracted Saratan and Robyn and they too stopped to look at me.

 "Aren't you supposed to be naked?" I asked.

 "It's too cold," Tiny said. "We've been practicing for the contest."

 I looked at Anne. "Would it be all right if I talked to Scribbles?"

 "Take him into the study," Anne said. "I'll send in some coffee."

 A small library, tables for studying, and a large stuffed couch filled the cozy room. Scribbles added a log to the fire and we sat on the couch. Outside, the storm kicked up spray off the lake and blew it against the window.

 "Are you mad at us?" Scribbles asked.

 "Why would... No. I was thinking you would be disgusted with me."

 "Anne said you got drunk and ran off with Littlewolf."

 "More like threw up all over her."

 "Really?"

 "I need your help."

 I pulled folded up paper from my pocket and we spent the afternoon going over the clues I had gathered about the Elevator. We made no particular progress with the mystery, but the discussion helped to clear my thinking and improved my mood.

 I stayed for dinner with the girls. And later, Anne and Saratan wrestled for me.

 #

 Winter passed in a blur. To be sure, socials and balls provided plenty of dancing and time with the girls. But school, it turned out, was more than courtship. We were expected to know things too. Each student was expected to complete a project, a scholarly work that demonstrated original thought. And the specter of the public examination, to be held in the late spring, gave new importance to the classes and studies we had taken so lightly in the fall.

 The easy going Proctor Lagrange we thought would be fair and not too hard. But the stern faced Scribe React, we feared.

 Often, especially when I went to bed exhausted, I dreamed of thrashing Ellipse. He never missed an opportunity to cultivate React's favor by pointing out flaws in my work.

 "Didn't you learn anything in Farhaven?" Orbie complained.

 "Who cares what Justice did what to whom?"

 "React cares," she replied.

 I never had any free time after that. Every day I went to Orbie's quarters for tutoring on history, then to Perigee's for law. And somehow Anne found out and sent Scribbles to torture me too.

 "At least you won't have to struggle with the project," Orbie said.

 "What do you mean?"

 "All you have to do is write about your expedition in the Spire. You're famous for that, so even a poorly done account should get by."

 Maybe so. But my project was the Elevator. To make time for the ancient accounts in the Library, I gave up the leisurely noontime meals. And each night, when I returned to my room, I stayed up late piecing together the evidence.

 But the long hours were no burden: a new plan for saving the Elevator began to form in my mind.

 #

 As spring approached, we had a parade.

 It had taken the winter cold to break Mercid's bandits. When the army had finally forced its way into the fort, they found hundreds of bandits frozen in their positions along the walls and hundreds more frozen in their bedrolls.

 The victorious army disbanded, letting the women return to their farms where they faced a winter's worth of work preparing their equipment for the spring planting. So only a small contingent of troops came home to Towerhold. But we all went down to the gate and cheered as they marched into the city.

 Axeblade rode next to the Justice General. They were mounted on the great horses the farmers favored for plowing and carrying armor into battle. When Axeblade saw me in the crowd, she reached down and I let her pull me up to ride behind her.

 "You look well," she said.

 "You look tired."

 "Have they kicked you out of school yet?"

 "Me? I'm their best student."

 I was glad to see Axeblade. Although when she found out about our expedition into the Spire, she lectured me about taking risks and leading the girls astray. But I didn't mind: it was like being home again.

 #

 Unfortunately, the opening of the road to Calmwater brought another, less welcome visitor to Towerhold.

 "Someone to see you," Ellipse announced as he passed by my desk in the library.

 "Who?" I asked, but I got no answer. Ellipse was gone.

 When I reached the parlor, I found a woman wearing a red bandanna.

 "You!"

 Captain Roma bowed low from the waist. "I bring a message from the Council of Ancestors."

 "You should be running," I threatened. "The sheriff doesn't like kidnappers."

 "It's Axeblade that should worry then."

 I glared at her. She stood there looking arrogant and righteous, daring me to make a fuss so she could embarrass Axeblade.

 "Your duty lies in Newtower," she declared.

 "I've got to save the Elevator."

 "The Council has said that it shall fall."

 "I say no."

 "I have orders." She withdrew a card from her pocket and handed it to me. It was the Ancestor Card.

 When you tell a fortune, it's the ancestors you call upon. They're dreaming of course: that's what happens when you die. And that's why you want to be good. If you're bad in life, your death dreams can get too weird for your descendants to understand. But good or bad, it's the ancestors that make you gypsy.

 The Ancestor Card was a summons to appear before the Council. A summons and a sentence: if I died, or lost the card, or otherwise failed to return it to the council, I would never dream; I would not be gypsy.

 I stared at the card for some time. When I looked up Roma was gone.

 #

 I welcomed the longer days and regretted the shorter nights as the spring equinox approached. Perigee then Ellipse and Orbie all presented their projects and I still was not ready. Finally, when even Retro's project was done and approved, Proctor Lagrange demanded my results. "Tomorrow," he ordered.

 The project presentations were somewhat informal. Proctor Lagrange, Scribe React, and the other students acted as judges, but even the spectators were allowed to ask question and issue challenges. Because I was pursuing my own agenda even more than the school's, I asked Anne, Littlewolf, and Candace to attend the presentation.

 I had painted my project on the largest canvas I could find. And I had brought it into the court covered with a cloth so no one could see it until I was ready.

 I began. "Once I rode a mechanical. From high in the air, you can look down and see the whole of the land. And that is my project, a portrait of the land. The land as seen by a mechanical."

 Pulling the cloth off the canvas, I pointed with my finger to the brown line representing the caravan road and traced its route across the canvas, from Farhaven to Calmwater, through the Rincons, and past Haystack Mountain to Towerhold. I pointed out the other features of the land, Farhaven valley, the Sea of Storms, the Rincons, the great escarpment, and the high eastern desert.

 "If you look closely," I concluded, "you can see I have drawn mechanicals at two places. Here at the Farhaven garage. And here to the southeast on the high desert, Tower Mech's garage."

 Ellipse was quick to criticize. "Well you've gotten it wrong then. Tower Mech's garage is in the Red Hills."

 "No. The Red Hills are too low for a garage. And they are to the east. But I have found accounts describing the mechanical flying over the Horns, to the southeast."

 "There's nothing in the southeast."

 "Wrong again. From the Spire we saw mountains there."

 Proctor Lagrange interrupted our haggling. "Why is this important?"

 "The portrait of the land was only part of my project," I explained. "I've been researching the Elevator. When the gypsies left Towerhold they removed vital components from the Spire. That's why we couldn't summon the Beast.

 "I believe that some things, keys and a memory, were sent off with Tower Mech. Now that I've located the garage, it's time to plan an expedition."

 "No!" Our eyes swung to the back of the room where Axeblade was rising to her feet. "There will be no expedition."

 "But the Elevator needs help."

 Axeblade made a chopping motion with her arm. "This matter is closed. There will be no more dangerous adventures."

 Axeblade's adamant prohibition of an expedition cast a pall over the remaining proceedings. No one else asked questions or offered comments, so the Proctor called a vote and the project was approved. Even Ellipse agreed to pass me.

 #

 When Anne, Littlewolf and Candace took me to the Gatekeeper's Inn to celebrate, I appealed to them for help.

 "I've got to get to the garage," I told them.

 Anne nodded. "Scribbles has been measuring the Elevator's curve. She says it's getting worse."

 "You are too eager to seek favor," Littlewolf chided Anne. "Your first duty is to protect Gypsy."

 "There are more important things," I said.

 "Be reasonable," Candace pleaded. "If we get caught even planning an expedition, Axeblade won't let us compete for you."

 "I don't have to be reasonable."

 "What you need to do," Littlewolf said, "is to grow up. Great Law, Gypsy, you have responsibilities."

 I choked back an angry retort. Littlewolf's expression, a mixture of exasperation and determination to argue, made it clear that she supported Axeblade. Candace looked too apologetic: she would not risk Axeblade's ire.

 Anne, however, when I looked to her, touched a finger to her lips, then changed the subject. "I understand Bekah claims to be the best archer in the school," she said.

 "Merchants always exaggerate," Candace replied. "It's their nature."

 Immediately, Littlewolf joined in and the girls began rating the fighting skills of the other captains. I wanted to badger them about the Elevator, but Anne had warned me off, so I joined their unspoken agreement to avoid the subject.

 Anne, I was sure, had not silenced me merely to avoid argument. But what was she thinking? The mystery deepened when, as we left the Inn, she whispered into my ear. "Bring the portrait to the island. Tell no one." 

 CHAPTER 11

 -- CONTESTANTS

 

 The trouble with secrets is that they're hard to keep. A boy lugging a large portrait through the city streets is bound to attract attention. The best I could do was remove the canvas from the frame and roll it up. Then after sunset, I slipped out through the kitchen and followed the alleyways to the island. No one, I think, noticed my passage.

 Tiny met me on the causeway and led me into the mansion where we found the whole company crowded into the study.

 Anne helped me unroll the portrait onto the table. "Gather around girls," she said, "so Gypsy can explain."

 I began. "This is a portrait of the land -- "

 "It's called a map," Scribbles interrupted.

 "Be quiet," Anne ordered.

 "But I saw one before," Scribbles protested, "in the book from Earth."

 "Okay, it's a map." I said. "Think of yourself flying a mechanical high above the land... "

 After I finished explaining the map and my theory about the garage, Anne asked, "What do you think, Saratan? Can we reach the garage?"

 "Supplies are the problem," she replied. "Figure three days to Sanctuary, another to climb the escarpment, three back to the horns, and four or five more to the garage -- round trip, maybe four weeks total, that's a lot to carry on our backs."

 "Assume we can. How long to prepare?"

 "Three or four days."

 "We can't do it then," Scribbles declared. When we all looked to her for an explanation, she continued. "The equinox is in two days, Gypsy has to pick a company -- Littlewolf I suppose -- and she won't let us take him on expedition."

 My face flushed as I felt their eyes shift to me. Where had the time gone? I wasn't ready for marriage. How did they expect me to worry about that and the Elevator too? Maybe Axeblade would let me wait another year. No. She was here to make sure it got done now. The Elevator and Anne, they went together. Could I give up Littlewolf and Candace to save it?

 I cleared my throat and looked at Anne. "If I give you my pennant, can you defend it?"

 "Will you?" she asked.

 Could I? My eyes dropped to her hooked nose then shifted about the room. They were good girls, I knew that, but suddenly my eyes couldn't focus on anything but crooked teeth, thick features, and Scribbles with her face inches from the map.

 #

 The next morning, the last day of the Northern Winter, Littlewolf found me in the Library. "Come walk with me," she offered.

 "I have studies."

 "The sun is out."

 "Well, for just a while."

 The spring had brought changes. The streets were dry, free at last from the snow and dirty slush. In the gardens, traces of new green growth impatiently chased the few remaining patches of snow into the shadows.

 She led me to the wall. We climbed to the top and stood looking westward towards the distant Rincon Mountains. I let her use a breeze as an excuse to put her arm around me.

 "Farhaven, a good name when you're standing here," she said.

 I smiled and looked up at her. "Are you turning into a poet, perhaps?"

 "Perhaps."

 For a moment I studied the way her blue eyes gazed intently at the horizon. Then as my eyes traced down the straight line of her nose to focus on the curve of her lips, I became aware of the press of her body against mine. Would she kiss me, I wondered.

 "We shouldn't be here," she said. "We have a farm to run."

 Law. What was I thinking? "Take me to the garage," I pleaded.

 "I promised Axeblade to take you back."

 The way she spread her hands made me think of Redblood. I shook my head to clear away distracting images. "You're forcing me to choose the human company," I warned.

 "No. You're not going to marry humans. You know that. Anne knows it too."

 #

 Even Retro picked at his food during lunch. At the far end of the table, I could hear Lagrange and React discuss plans for rearranging the flowerbeds in the garden. In the middle of the table, Ellipse and Retro whispered softly to keep their conversation from the girls.

 "I'm not giving a speech."

 "You have to. The girls expect it."

 "What are you going to say?"

 "That they're lucky to get me."

 "Are you going to choose Bekah?"

 "Market is so far. Ethyl has a farm near Sanctuary."

 "What will you call your company?"

 "It's not fair. All the good names are taken."

 Across the table, Orbie pushed his food around his plate. He kept glancing up at me, but whenever I met his eyes he looked away. Finally he asked, "Are you mad?"

 "For what?"

 "Candace spoke to me. I told her she could compete for me."

 "Oh."

 #

 Candace should have told me, I thought, but I was not really surprised. She wasn't good with conflict. What really vexed me, was that her desertion reduced me to my last option, an appeal to Axeblade.

 After lunch I found Axeblade at the Tower Court with the Justice General. "I'm not ready for marriage," I announced. "Not until I've dealt with the Elevator."

 Instead of shouting, which I expected, Axeblade nodded sympathetically. "Choosing a company can be hard. Did you know that Apogee tried to delay his marriage to Redblood?"

 I shook my head. Not marry Redblood?

 "He's happy now, of course. You will be too, when it's over."

 I continued to shake my head. "There's still the Elevator."

 "Do you know Captain Roma?" The Justice General asked.

 I frowned. What was this about?

 "We've spoken with her," the Justice General continued. "She assures us that there is no danger."

 "She wants it to fall," I protested. "They're going to invade after it kills us off."

 The Justice General raised an eyebrow. "That seems a bit farfetched."

 Axeblade just rolled her eyes.

 You would think grown women would know better than to believe a gypsy.

 #

 They held court in the ballroom, but even so, they ran out of space for spectators. Curious townsfolk elbowed their way into the standing area behind the invited guests. Families and friends of the students packed into the chairs at the rear. The Justice General, Axeblade, and other dignitaries near the bandstand chatted comfortably among themselves, seemingly unaware of the crush behind them.

 A table for Proctor Lagrange stood in the center of the bandstand. On its surface, trappings of the court -- the purple covering, the Book of One Law, and the Book of Rules -- emphasized the legal significance of the ceremony. The student captains sat to the Proctor's right; the boys sat to his left.

 React, wearing a heavy robe and carrying the Staff of Law, acted as bailiff. Satisfied that the court was properly assembled, he stepped to the front of the bandstand and banged the staff three times onto the floor. "Silence," he commanded. "The court begins."

 Proctor Lagrange emerged from behind the bandstand and took his seat. He looked briefly around the court, and seeing that all was in order, he began. "The equinox begins the season of growth, the growth of crops and the growth of family. Today these students... "

 They should open the windows. I wiped the sweat from my palms onto my trousers. The overcrowded room added to the events closing in on me. Quests were not supposed to be like this. You went out, fought some bandits, managed a few escapes, won, and lived happily ever after.

 But they were going to make me marry the humans. The bios' obsession with their farms made them blind to the danger of the Elevator. And the gypsies were so intent on revenge that they sought the destruction of the world. Only the humans shared my fear for the Elevator.

 Five girls. Which three would I pick? Or could I keep more? Imagine the gossip.

 Proctor Lagrange must have finished. Perigee, who had been sitting calmly with his hands in his lap, rose slowly and said, "I offer my pennant to Judith."

 His choice was no surprise to anyone, but the audience applauded politely and Hanna patted Judith's shoulder while React delivered Perigee's pennant to Judith. The audience stirred more when a girl broke out of the standing crowd and came down the aisle, waving her hand in the air to get the Proctor's attention.

 React, when he saw the girl, again banged his staff three times on the floor.

 "Who petitions the court?" the Proctor demanded of the girl.

 "I am Rachel, from the rice farms." A swamp girl. I wondered how she came to know Perigee, a city boy.

 "Your petition?"

 "I ask the privilege of competing for Perigee's pennant."

 When the Proctor looked to Perigee, he said, "You were at the rice farm when I visited last summer. But why haven't you come to court me?"

 "I was at Fort Rincon."

 A warrior. Perigee could not refuse. He nodded and said, "You may compete, but be warned: I require a substantial victory."

 Rachel took a deep breath and nodded. The requirement for a substantial victory ruled out the use of champions: every girl in both companies would fight. To take Perigee's pennant away from Judith, Rachel's girls would need to win both the archery and the wrestling competitions.

 #

 I almost snickered when no one challenged India's right to Ellipse's pennant. His unpleasant demeanor had finally caught up with him. However, Retro's ape like behavior seemed popular with the girls. Despite what he had said the previous day, he chose Bekah and allowed both Ethyl and Mira to challenge. As expected, Orbie chose Hannah and allowed Candace to challenge.

 When my turn came, I stood and looked across the court to the girls. Littlewolf sat easy in her confidence that I would chose her over the humans. Anne's hawk eyes burned with intensity. However, the girls, by their actions, had already determined my choice. And at that moment, when I looked into Anne's eyes, I felt the rightness of my decision.

 "I offer my pennant to Jurist Anne."

 The courtroom buzzed and Axeblade shook hands with the Justice General. Anne smiled in quiet satisfaction as she took my pennant from React and rubbed the silver cloth between her fingers. Littlewolf, her face screwed up in disgust, rose and raised a hand.

 I could not afford charity. When she asked permission to challenge for my pennant, I issued my own challenge, "Will you take me on expedition?"

 "You know I can't."

 "Won't, you mean. I can't let you challenge."

 Littlewolf merely shrugged and turned to the Proctor. "I have the Mechanic's permission to court Gypsy."

 Renewed murmurs from the audience prevented the Proctor from replying. Another woman, Captain Roma, stood with her hand raised to issue her unwelcome petition. "This boy does not have the permission of the gypsies to court with any farmer. I challenge for his pennant."

 I spit my answer out. "Enemies can't challenge."

 For once, React had no need to pound the floor with his staff. The court became completely quiet as we waited for the Proctor to rule.

 "Despite their possible merits, the petitions have been denied. If Littlewolf or Captain Roma wish to persist, they must issue hostile challenges in the arena."

 #

 The favored girls -- Judith, India, Bekah, Hanna, and Anne -- held their pennants aloft and pushed through the audience. Cheers and shouts greeted their appearance at the door, and as they found their companies and supporters, the commotion moved off down the street towards the arena.

 Shoulder pats and words of encouragement seemed to bolster the other girls -- Rachel, Ethyl, Mira, Candace, and Littlewolf -- as they passed through the audience. They exited into the street looking excited and determined, and their supporters created plenty of noise as they marched to the arena.

 I was for rushing out with the crowd, but Perigee held us in our seats. "The parade is for the girls," he said.

 So after the ballroom cleared, we strolled down an empty street following sounds of distant excitement. But after a short walk, we entered the Arena of Harvest Justice and found ourselves immersed in the spring festival. I paused, for just a moment, to watch a woman juggle yellow and red balls, but when I looked around, the other boys were gone.

 In theory, the arena was logically arranged. A raised platform for spectators and officials sat in the center, surrounded on three sides by the horseshoe shaped field. On one leg of the horseshoe, an archery range butted against the platform; on the other leg, the wrestling pits bordered the platform.

 Logic, however, broke down on the sandy field. Merchants erected tents haphazardly, sometimes in rows, sometimes not. In the clear areas, performers lay out hay bales to make little theaters. Spectators clogged the aisles as they wandered aimlessly about, and little knots of girls bumped people aside as the companies rushed about on important errands.

 "Where is everybody?" I asked Candace as her company rushed past.

 "Follow us," she shouted. "Tell Anne," she added as I fell in behind her, "some idiot set the targets wrong. They're a full pace too long. Arrows need aiming a little higher."

 They led me to the company camps at the center of the horseshoe. The favored companies proudly displayed their pennants on poles set before their canopies. But pennant or not, the girls moved about with a confident air, encouraged by loud supporters who sat on seats built against the outer wall. I could hear the merry shouts of encouragement and see the wine and beer being passed around.

 #

 "Gypsy, come with me."

 I looked down to see Bitty, one of the little human girls from the island school, tugging at my sleeve. "Are you lost?" I asked.

 "No, that's Itty, I'm looking for her, come see the camp, we've got a pennant."

 My pennant was there, silver cloth fluttering in the breeze over a display of weapons. On the left side of the canopy, unstrung bows stood precisely arranged in a rack; along the front of the canopy, swords lay in a neat line across a table; and on the right, quivers full of arrows hung down from the canopy edge; in the center, an assortment of buckets and equipment boxes provided storage for bandages, oils, water, and other supplies.

 The company, instructors, kids from the island school -- perhaps every human in the city -- swarmed around the picnic area behind the canopy. A few busy girls worked at picking apart a roasted pig; others tended fires heating pots of beans and corn. The older girls and women lined up to fill their mugs from kegs of beer and wine.

 Itty saw us first. "Bitty," she hollered. "Mother says you got to stay here, you'll get lost."

 React couldn't have done better pounding his staff. As the girls sensed my presence, they turned to stare and a pocket of silence fell over the campground. The weight of their gaze seemed to make even the calls of the vendors fade away.

 Anne bowed. "Thank you."

 "You're welcome. You earned it."

 She gestured towards an equipment box. "Perhaps you would like to say a few words?"

 "Well perhaps I could manage something." I took my time mounting the equipment box, but I was eager to begin. I had the perfect speech; it had taken me days to work out. However, the girls, I knew, would expect something scholarly, so I had to act calm.

 I looked around to make sure all the girls were present. Perfect. And I had everyone's attention.

 "The farmer's army," I began, "was not always victorious. At first they kept falling into ambushes. The barbarians would take them by surprise, kill a bunch of women, then run off.

 "Alarmed by the heavy casualties, the Justice General decided to try a desperate experiment. 'Assemble all the human girls into scout companies,' she ordered. 'Send them out to track the barbarians.'

 "So the human girls, who were too small for the heavy fighting, found their place in the army. It's written that many were killed, but they did their duty, and the farmer's army was never again ambushed."

 My glance passed from girl to girl, to Saratan and Tiny, Robyn and Scribbles, and Anne. "I was going to compare you to those ancient humans, to say how you too had to make your own place. But it occurs to me that you've already done that. You've been friends. And you've helped me when no one else would.

 "I'm proud of you. And I know you can defend my pennant. Anne will have a plan. So don't get distracted by insults. And don't get discouraged by setbacks. Do your jobs."

 #

 "Roma and Littlewolf are at the pits."

 Anne pitched her sandwich into the garbage barrel. "Saratan, Robyn, come with me."

 I scrambled to my feet but they were gone, disappeared into the crowd. No matter, I ducked around girls and snaked my way to the pits in time to see Shortbull facing off against a stout gypsy girl. Bosun, I remembered, was her name.

 Shortbull should learn some moves, I thought as she locked up with Bosun in another test of strength. Only this time Shortbull prevailed: she forced Bosun over backwards and into the sand.

 While Roma helped Bosun up from the sand, I looked around for Anne. Somehow she had gotten up onto the first row of the grandstand where she had a perfect view of the contest. She was busy mock fighting with Robyn, using animated gestures to work out a strategy for dealing with Shortbull's strength.

 I felt a growing uneasiness in my stomach as my gaze shifted from Saratan to Shortbull. For a human, Saratan was strong, but Shortbull was a strong bios. She would break Saratan like a twig.

 When Littlewolf stepped out onto the sand to face Roma, that set the order of combat for our fight with the winner. The best fighters always went first, so assuming Littlewolf won, it would be Shortbull, Littlewolf, and Yellowbird against Saratan, Robyn, and Anne.

 Littlewolf lost. She tried to be clever and fast, faking first one way then the other, but Roma countered with a steady defense. Roma kept turning towards her, neither retreating nor advancing, letting Littlewolf engage and disengage as she wished. Littlewolf, who was doing all the work, soon tired and eventually made an overly aggressive charge that got her pitched into the sand.

 Yellowbird fought an awkward match against Mate to settle the wrestling. They grappled belly-to-belly with their arms around each other and couldn't do much except stagger about.

 "Give her a big kiss for me," someone in the crowd yelled. Others began booing the poor show.

 Luck settled it. When the embarrassed girls pushed apart, Mate stumbled. Yellowbird was quick enough to push at her shoulder, and the off balance Mate went down.

 "Will you concede?" Littlewolf asked Roma.

 Roma's eyes flashed. "Our days of conceding to farmers are over."

 To her credit, Littlewolf met Roma's gaze without flinching. She pushed past her and we went around to the archery range.

 Anne, I think, had paid girls to hold seats for her. When she made her way to the front row of the archery range, some girls surrendered their seats to her, Saratan, and Robyn. Once again they watched closely and had animated discussions after each girl shot her arrows.

 But I doubt they learned much: the contest between the farmers and gypsies was dull. Yellowbird, Littlewolf, and Shortbull each defeated Roma, Mate, and Bosun on the first flight. Gypsies made poor archers.

 Roma remained defiant. "The pennant is not the real prize," she told Littlewolf. "And you shall not have that."

 As she spoke, she turned to look straight into my eyes.

 #

 "I've come for the pennant," Littlewolf said to Anne. "Will you surrender it, or must I take it?"

 We had been back at the camp only a few minutes when Littlewolf showed up to make her challenge. Anne, who had just filled her mug with punch, set it down and filled another mug with wine.

 "Good work with Roma," Anne said as she offered the wine to Littlewolf.

 Littlewolf hesitated but accepted the wine, and when Anne made a show of chugging down her punch, Littlewolf tipped back the mug and downed the wine. Saratan and Robyn made a show of filling mugs for Shortbull and Yellowbird, and all the girls tried to stare each other down as they emptied the mugs.

 Red punch versus red wine -- I stared out at the fair and tried to keep my mouth closed. Big day. I was going to end up with either cheats or fools.

 "We'll be taking the pennant now," Littlewolf announced.

 "A hostile challenge," Anne said. "Gypsy gets to set the terms."

 When they turned to me, I faced Littlewolf. "So you think you can trounce the human girls?"

 "Very clever." She smiled rather ruefully but nodded her head. "They will not win even the one match. The terms are agreed."

 #

 The wrestling was a laugh. Saratan, Robyn, and then Anne went into the sand. Anne was still spitting sand from her mouth when Scribbles and Tiny began passing out mugs. Anne raised hers towards Littlewolf and said, "Good match."

 This time Littlewolf smiled as they drained their mugs. She though it funny, I suppose, that the human girl was trying to out drink her.

 At the archery range, I almost ruined everything. "Hey," I said when Anne stepped up next to Yellowbird. I had expected Saratan, our best archer.

 If Anne had turned, I would have complained about the break with protocol. The best archers always go first. That was the rule. But Anne did not turn. Everyone else did, so I knew she had heard me. Instead she fiddled with her bow and stared deliberately down range. She was up to something.

 "I... ah... may the best girl win." I felt like a fool for stammering, but it's not easy to say something without saying anything. But when I saw Anne relax, I knew nothing was the right thing to say.

 The match was over on the first volley. Yellowbird bunched all three arrows in the exact center of the bull's-eye. Anne managed only one bull's-eye. Littlewolf's company did not even bother celebrating as Anne ran down the range to retrieve the spent arrows, a duty always left to the loser of each match.

 I bit my lip when Robyn stepped up to the line with Littlewolf. Was Saratan injured?

 Robyn at least gave a good account of herself against Littlewolf. They went two rounds before Robyn let an arrow drift out of the bull's-eye.

 When Saratan stepped to the line against Shortbull, I finally figured out Anne's plan. She was cheating again. We needed only one victory to defend the pennant, so she was putting our best archer against their worst. Saratan could do it. She had to.

 Round after round, both girls shot perfect flights, three arrows into the bull's-eye. But the wine, I think, finally got to Shortbull. On the last round, she seemed to get shaken when her first arrow just nicked the bull's-eye. She over compensated with the next arrow and put it outside the bull's-eye on the other side. Then she conceded the contest completely with a lackluster third arrow that missed low.

 #

 "It's for the best," I told them. "Gypsy boys are too wild for the farm."

 Littlewolf kept her eyes on the ground. She was fighting, I think, to hold back tears. But girls aren't supposed to cry, so I gave her a quick squeeze on the arm and let Anne lead me back to the camp.

 I tried not to look back, but I did. Littlewolf stood there with Shortbull on her left, Yellowbird on her right. They put their arms around each other as they watched me leave. Would it be better or worse for them, I wondered, to know that they had been cheated?

 Anne must have seen me looking. When a surge in the crowd took them out of view, she said, "They're good girls. They'll find their farm boy."

 "Either way," I said. "We'll be breaking hard ground for eternity."

 "Yes."

 The farmers, being farmers, believe that if you are good, you go to this farm where the crops always come in, the animals are healthy, and people are nice. Of course if you're bad, the ground will be rocky, the horses will kick you, and your neighbors won't help.

 At the camp, loud whooping sounds filled the air as the crowd cheered Saratan. Robyn and Scribbles had her on their shoulders and they marched around in circles while she downed a full mug of beer. She didn't seem to care when golden liquid spilled out the sides of her mouth and ran down her blouse.

 I searched out the other girls. Robyn tried to get Saratan to take another mug. Tiny, who also had a mug, made sour faces as she sipped at it. Anne wiped foam from her lips. Two seconds in camp and the girls were already drinking.

 They'll be sorry. Drinking, I knew too well, was a sin you paid for in this life.

 "Well done daughter," a voice called out from behind me. I turned to see the Justice General enter the camp. She grabbed Anne and patted her back while they hugged.

 Axeblade was there too and I got a quick hug from her. "We will miss you in Farhaven," she said.

 "I'll come visit."

 "I'll take that as a promise."

 The Justice General kept an arm around Anne and pulled her towards us. "Will you commission the company?" she asked me.

 "Wait," Axeblade interrupted. She spoke to Anne, "I want your promise not to endanger Gypsy."

 "We'll protect him," Anne said.

 "There is to be no expedition."

 Anne's eyes assumed that hawk-like intensity that signaled her determination to have her own way. "We promised to help him."

 Axeblade stared back at her, then sighed. "Be careful," she said as she held out her hand.

 When the two women shook hands, I stepped quickly onto the equipment box -- no need to give Axeblade time to change her mind. But Axeblade simply held her arms up for silence, an unnecessary gesture because everyone was already looking at me.

 "You remember the human scouts I told you about? The ones that fought the barbarians?" I asked Anne.

 She nodded and when I looked, I could see the other girls nodding also.

 "I propose," I continued, "that this company be known as the Scout Company. Will you accept this name?"

 Anne bowed slightly. "It would be an honor."

 "Then I commission you Captain of Scouts." 

 CHAPTER 12

 -- WIVES

 

 The trouble with wives is that they make you kiss them. It happened when I helped Saratan take the other girls home.

 "You can't sleep here," I told Anne. I had let her sit on the stone wall that bordered the causeway while Scribbles threw up into the water. Now Anne was trying to lie down. When Saratan got Scribbles back onto her feet, I slipped my shoulder under Anne's arm and made her get up.

 Robyn and Tiny, who supported each other as they brought up the rear, were up to something. I heard them whispering together, and every time I glanced back to see what they were doing, they broke into a fit of guilty giggles.

 I had my own schemes. The girls had never let me into their quarters before, so I helped Anne into the mansion just to get a look. The light flickering from a single candle on the mantel was too dim to reveal many secrets, but they slept on the floor, I saw, on thin cushions that circled a bath in the center of the room. And they kept their gear in open cabinets that lined the walls.

 Lowering Anne to her cushion made me drop to my knees and that's when Robyn and Tiny struck. They pulled on my hips to roll me onto my back then flopped down on top of me.

 "Let me up," I demanded as I pushed at them.

 But they pinned my arms down. "We want a kiss," Tiny said.

 "Captain's supposed to be first," I said as I dodged her lips.

 But the motion only exposed me to Robyn; she found my mouth and brushed her lips against mine. It surprised me how soft she felt. Girls were supposed to be tough.

 #

 I ate breakfast with Liltih, one of the girls in the kitchen staff. She made coffee and put out baking powder biscuits and cherry jam.

 "You didn't celebrate?" she asked.

 "Don't like wine," I said between bites. "Makes you sick."

 She nodded. "Later, I'll make clear soup for the boys."

 With the girls gone and the boys in bed, the school was too quiet. I wrote a letter for Axeblade to take to Apogee, sat with Orbie while he sipped at his soup, ate a sandwich for lunch, took a nap, got up, and went searching for something to read.

 I was in the library when Anne found me.

 "Are you mad?" I asked. She had to be. After Robyn got me, I had to let Tiny do it, and then later when Saratan took me home, I had to let her kiss me too.

 "Mad? For what?"

 "Ah... nothing. You look unhappy is all."

 "I need coffee. Come to the Inn with me."

 #

 We took our coffee to a table near a window. Outside, women worked at hitching horses to wagons, preparing to get a caravan under way.

 "I wonder where they are going?"

 "Most likely east to Market," Anne said. "Carrying paper and pottery bought at the festival."

 "Long journey. You remember how we thought we would never get here?"

 Anne changed her mind. "No, they're not going to Market, those are iron wagons, and they're not empty, so they're going north to Sanctuary."

 I shook my head. "That make's no sense. Why would the gypsies be going north?"

 "Gypsies?"

 "I'll be glad to be rid of them," I said as I pointed past the caravan into the stables. Women with red bandannas -- Roma, Mate, and Bosun -- were helping harness horses.

 Anne rose from the table. "Wait here, I'll be back."

 She left the inn and a few minutes later I saw her over by the caravan.

 #

 I eased away when Tiny's arm and leg brushed against me, but the motion took me into Robyn who slipped her arm around my waist. Tiny's arm snaked around my shoulder.

 Fortunately, Anne had her eyes on the map. "Why are the gypsies going north?" she asked.

 "It's obvious," Scribbles said. She was standing on the other side of the table with Saratan. "They're taking the northern route around Haystack Mountain." To prove her point, Scribbles traced out the route on the map. "First they go north to Sanctuary. Then they go west to Market."

 Saratan, I noticed, did not look down at the map. She seemed fascinated by the way Robyn and Tiny had me sandwiched between them.

 "What if they go east from Sanctuary?" Anne asked.

 "There's nothing to the east."

 Anne put her finger on the map and moved it eastwards from Sanctuary. "Expeditions to the high desert always leave from Sanctuary. The escarpment has fallen away there, so it's an easy climb to the top."

 My stomach turned over with apprehension as the map finally captured my attention. Only one reason could take the gypsies to the high desert.

 "I'm right about the garage," I said. "And right about the memory and keys. They're going to destroy them so we can't save the Elevator."

 #

 It took forever to get across the lake.

 When I looked down at the side of the skiff, I could see the water slipping quickly to the rear. And when I lifted my gaze I saw the other skiffs skimming over the surface. But when I looked ahead to the water's edge, motion seemed to disappear. All I could see was a green smudge that provided no features to focus on, no gages for distance.

 Some shortcut, I thought.

 The gypsies had a head start, but they would need six or seven days to travel to Sanctuary, climb the escarpment, and return south to the Horns. If we could get across the swamp, and if we could climb the Staircase, we might still beat them to the garage.

 I looked back at the city. The walls, I noticed, had already shrunk from distance. When I returned my attention to the front, the swamp still lay an indeterminate distance ahead, but above it, the Escarpment had grown.

 The Staircase, which from the city appeared a short climb, began to reveal forbidding details. As the dark green gash stepped steeply up towards the Horns, ribbons of water rushed over ledges and cascaded down towards the swamp. Already I could hear a low rumble and see mist rising where the water struck at rock.

 The company, three flat-bottomed skiffs, seemed too tiny for the task, but I kept my thoughts to myself. The escarpment isn't growing, Scribbles would argue, we're shrinking. And what would I say to that? How would you know?

 The skiffs rode high in the water. Anne had wanted them lightly loaded, so each held only two girls and a pile of camp gear. They set me behind Saratan and gave me a paddle, but no one complained when I got tired and stopped paddling. Saratan worked in a smooth rhythm, lifting the paddle cleanly from the water and then pulling it firmly back. She seemed tireless, but because the day was warm, she worn a sleeveless blouse, and I could see a thin film of sweat form on her arms.

 Finally, Anne raised her paddle into the air and the girls let the skiffs drift to a stop. The green smudge at the water's edge had become a five-foot high wall of scrubby brush across our path. To the left, a gray slab of rock briefly interrupted the march of vegetation, but otherwise, the barrier continued unbroken to either side.

 #

 The rock was maybe fifty feet long and lay at an angle with one end in the water and the other sticking up above the brush. Anne brought her skiff alongside and scampered up the slope. She stood on the high end and surveyed the swamp.

 "What do you see?" I called.

 "There's a channel." She examined the brush below her feet. "We can get through here."

 Sliding down the rock, she returned to the skiff and guided Robyn to the brush under the overhanging rock. I saw only a solid tangle of branches and vines, but slowly the skiff nosed into them and disappeared. Scribbles and Tiny took their skiff in next, and Saratan guided us in close behind.

 Under the overhang, the sluggish swamp water produced just enough current to keep the brush from completely choking the channel. Saratan reached out and used the branches to pull us forward. As the skiff's flat bottom scraped over floating branches, tendrils of vines and unthinkable things reached down and brushed my face.

 I ducked low and closed my eyes. "Hurry."

 We stopped.

 "It's blocked," Anne shouted.

 Under the rock, the swamp was too quiet. Ahead, Anne and Robyn chopped branches, and somewhere above, birds screeched at each other. But we were stuck in murky realm where things crept about in silence.

 I brushed stuff away from my face and opened my eyes. Over Saratan's shoulder, I could make out Scribbles and Tiny waiting calmly in their skiff. Saratan bumped our skiff into theirs, but they couldn't go anywhere.

 I rubbed at a tickle in my nose. In the wilderness the little human girls somehow seem bigger, more competent. And even in the city, they had proved themselves against the bios girls. Maybe I had not chosen so badly after all.

 "We're through," Anne finally announced.

 Daylight flooded in as Scribbles and Tiny pulled from under the rock, and we followed them out onto a pool of open water.

 #

 Close up, the swamp looked different. From the Spire, I had seen ribbons of open water interconnecting a multitude of ponds. But setting on this pond, I saw only barriers. Behind, the solid wall of bush rose up around the lake border. Ahead, the little pool of water seemed completely surrounded by floating mats of rotting vegetation. In the distance, scattered clumps of dark green marked brush covered islands. The Escarpment, which had grown close on the lake, now seemed impossibly remote.

 The girls, however, were undeterred by barriers. When we emerged from under the rock, Anne and Robyn were already across the pond and into the swamp. And already the grass had sprung back up behind them, leaving only their heads and shoulders visible.

 During the morning, our little flotilla worked its way deeper and deeper into the swamp. At first, the grass slid easily under the skiffs. But as we neared the center of the swamp, the channels narrowed and the grass thickened.

 Saratan lost her rhythm. I found out why when I tried to help. The thick grass bunched up under the skiff and dragged against us. And it grabbed at the paddles. Soon we were reduced to using the paddles as poles to push the skiff forward. But even that failed: my paddle stuck in the muck and pulled from my grasp.

 "Hey," I shouted.

 Saratan stopped, but the swamp clung to its prize. The muck held the paddle fast until I braced my knees against the skiff sides and used both hands to pull it free. The blade came out heavy with inky mud.

 "We're stuck," Anne called from ahead.

 Scribbles and Tiny, I saw, were sitting motionless in their skiff. Anne's skiff was out of sight, but I saw her head sticking above the tall grass when she stood to survey the path ahead.

 "I can see water," Anne announced. "But we'll have to carry the skiffs."

 First, we heard splashes as Anne and Robyn went into the swamp; then we saw Scribbles and Tiny undo their shoes and slip into the slimy water. They sank up to their waists and began pushing the skiff along as they struggled forward.

 I lowered myself into the swamp. "Real girls wouldn't make me do this."

 "We didn't say nothing," Tiny said.

 "You were looking. I saw you." Cold crept up my legs and mud oozed through my toes as I sank.

 Saratan began pulling at the skiff.

 I couldn't decide which was worse: the mud, which sucked at my feet; or the grass, which cut at my legs. The best way to move, I found, was to pull the skiff forward a few feet, then lean on it as I tugged first one foot free, then the other.

 Tiny stumbled and fell. For a moment, the wet blouse clung to her skin and revealed a hint of small mounds tipped with dark nipples. I looked away. They wouldn't all make me take them as wives. Would they?

 "We're floating," Anne shouted. But I couldn't see her. She was somewhere beyond the trail of mashed down grass.

 #

 Floating, to Anne, meant that we could use the paddles. To me it meant that I could dangle my feet over the sides and rinse away the mud. No matter that the water was scummy: it was better than the slime.

 No one wanted lunch. We spent the afternoon working our way eastwards. Gradually, the swamp surrendered to larger ponds until we reached the long ribbon of water that hugged the base of the Escarpment.

 However, instead of turning south to the Staircase, Anne led us straight across the open water. At the far side, the Escarpment plunged straight down into the water, so we were able to bring the skiffs alongside and run our hands over the rock. The great fracture that had separated the Escarpment from the land had left the rock free of ledges or handholds.

 "We can't climb this," Scribbles declared.

 Saratan frowned agreement. "Let's hope the Staircase is better," she said.

 I lay back in the skiff and looked up at the black landscape. "Hey, let's turn the world on end. We could just walk up."

 "It would be easy," Tiny said. She too was on her back.

 The corners of Saratan's mouth stayed down as she used her paddle to push the skiff away from the rock.

 We made a lethargic journey south. Scribbles claims that there is just so much energy in the world. Perhaps we had used our share in the swamp. We paddled, but the morning flight across the water was reduced to an afternoon glide.

 But if our energy remained low, our attention, at least, heightened as we approached the Staircase. The once distant roar of falling water became more immediate, and we approached a cloud of mist that clung to the side of the Escarpment.

 Anne led us away from the mist. When we reached the swamp side of the water opposite the Staircase, she stopped to survey the Staircase.

 The Staircase, a jagged gash in the Escarpment, rose from the mist and angled to the north. We could see water flowing down the gash, over a series of ledges that looked very much like stairs. The water pouring over the bottom step, a hundred-foot fall, kicked up the spray and produced the roar. A brilliant rainbow framed the mist. A grand arch -- a full half circle rainbow -- was, I knew, a rare sight. But there it was.

 "There's no place to land," Scribbles shouted.

 Anne, if she made a response, could not be heard, but she pointed into the Escarpment opposite the waterfall. Behind the mist, there seemed to be an inlet formed where the gash met the lake.

 We were more attentive to the paddles when we followed Anne into the mist. We had to be. The other boats faded into the mist, leaving us all alone. Saratan guided us away from white water boiling on our left, but the black shadow of the rock face blocked our path to the right. At the very base of the waterfall, white water spread completely across our path and lapped at the rock wall.

 Saratan dug her paddle into the water and began pulling as hard as she could. I followed her lead, and we shot across the turbulence into calmer water. As we emerged from the mist, we saw Scribbles and Tiny, then Anne and Robyn. They were heading deeper into the inlet to where a series of smaller, more reasonable, ledges stepped up into the gash.

 #

 The ledge made a poor camp. Anne had wanted to climb higher, but feared that the approaching darkness would catch us climbing, so we had to make do.

 The western end of the ledge, at the face of the Escarpment, was too wet. The main stream of water overshot the ledge as it fell from above, but mist rose up from the lake that was only some fifty feet below. The only flat spot on the ledge was too close to the falls. The roar from the falls drowned out our voices and the spray coated everything with moisture.

 At least storms had washed sand down from above to fill in the gaps between rocks, so we would have soft ground to sleep on. And deeper in the inlet, Saratan found dry wood for the fire. And under the falls, spray and small streams collected to form the pond where the girls were bathing.

 "Gypsy come wash my back."

 With the roar from the falls pounding at my ears, I wasn't sure I heard her correctly until I looked towards the pond. Robyn stood under a ledge letting water splash down on her from above. Whatever she said hadn't been nice because, when I turned to look, the girls broke into giggles.

 I had tried to keep busy with the fire while the girls washed off the swamp grime. But you can only poke at it so much when they want your attention. They were all naked: Scribbles and Tiny were helping each other wash their hair; Anne and Saratan were soaping down their bodies; and Robyn was rinsing herself.

 "Come on in," Robyn called. "We'll wash your back."

 They were laughing even before I flushed and shook my head, but they weren't all as bold as they pretended. When I didn't turn away, Tiny slid down into the water and Scribbles carefully fixed her attention on Tiny's hair.

 Robyn, however, whispered something to Tiny and the two girls began laughing and glancing at me as they hatched another scheme. The other girls paused for an uncertain moment, then took their cue from Scribbles and resumed bathing. While Anne watched my reaction, her hand rose up and lightly stroked over the curve of her breast.

 I turned back to the fire.

 #

 Even though we had skipped lunch, Scribbles could not be hurried. The sun was already dropping behind the Rincons when she began boiling the noodles. Darkness descended before she mixed them with melted cheese, and so we ate by the light of the fire.

 It did no good to push Robyn and Tiny away. They sat on either side of me and kept leaning their arms and legs against me. I played with my noodles, hoping they would leave when they finished, but Robyn set her plate on the ground and slipped her arm around my waist. So I wolfed my noodles down and waited for Anne to finish.

 I rose when Anne did and cupped my hand to her ear. "Come stand guard," I asked. When she nodded, I tugged at her hand and led her to the pond.

 Guards, I thought, were supposed to remain standing on duty, but when I sat on a rock at the pond's edge, she sat next to me. She didn't, however, try to touch me, so I undid my shoes and began to remove my clothes. As she watched me undress, light from the fire outlined her silhouette and cast a flaxen glow through her hair and over her cheek, but shadows hid details of her face and body. She could not see too much, I told myself. Still, I ignored the shock of cold water to slip quickly into the pond and swim away from her.

 I let sound and spray guide me into the cave like area between falling water and rock, and after a moment of groping in the dark, I found the soap. But when I stood to begin washing, I felt soft hands sliding over my back. I turned and Anne was there, her face inches from mine.

 Her lips, when she kissed me, had that surprising softness, and the warmth of her body made me press against her. I let her push me past the falls and down onto a little beach of sand. She murmured instructions, which I couldn't hear over the rush of water, but when she placed my hand on her breast I discovered another surprise. Somehow I had the idea that breasts were all fluff, but they were heavy in my hand, and when she moved higher over me, a hard nipple brushed my lips.

 #

 "I didn't expect it to hurt," Anne said.

 I brushed hair from her forehead. Maybe humans weren't supposed to do it. "You didn't like it?"

 "It was wonderful." She pulled me to her and we exchanged soft kisses until the chill of mist and night air drove us off the little beach.

 So I was married. And the girls knew it: Scribbles never made coffee at night, but there they were -- sitting around the fire holding cups that steamed in their hands.

 "Thanks," I said when Scribbles handed me a cup. I wrapped my fingers around the hot metal and knelt by the fire. "This is great."

 "We want to do it too," Tiny announced.

 I blew on my coffee. "Do what?"

 No one said, but when my eyes flicked from face to face, I could see that they all knew what. Later when we finished our coffee, I moved my bedroll next to Anne's. I had promised to marry them, not to make it easy.

 #

 The next morning the sun was just touching the tip of the Spire when we started up the Staircase. We settled into a rhythm. Saratan would lead the way up each cliff, using her stout muscles to pull herself up from handhold to handhold. Whenever she came to a suitable ledge, she would drop a rope and help Anne up. Then she would attack the next obstacle.

 The rest of us used the ropes to follow whenever we could find room on the ledge above us. Soon we were spread out over two, and sometimes three ledges, forming a long line of girls, rope, and supplies moving slowly up the escarpment.

 When Anne signaled down the line for the midday break, I was at the bottom with Robyn and Tiny.

 "Just our luck," I complained. Scribbles was pulling the last pack up to her level. "We'll have to climb up to get lunch."

 But when I tried to reach the rope, Robyn put out her hand and trapped me against the rock. "A kiss," she demanded.

 "No..."

 I turned my head and would have pushed her away but the brush of her lips across my neck sent a thrill through me. Okay, you can kiss me.

 "We want to see you naked," she said.

 "No!"

 But she continued to caress my neck as her hands pulled my shirt free from my trousers. I let her do it. When she kept pulling up on the shirt, I raised my arms and let her take it over my head. I was glad to have the rock to lean against. It made me weak, the way her eyes searched over my chest and stomach.

 "Let's take everything off," Tiny said. She dropped to her knees and undid my bootlaces, and then made me lift my legs as she pulled boots and socks off.

 As Tiny pulled my trousers down, Robyn's gaze became so intense that I could feel it caressing me. Tiny rose and they stood together, looking at me.

 "You touch it, then I will," Robyn said.

 "No, you first."

 #

 In the distance we could see the mountains where I suspected Tower Mech had made his garage. We could also see a ribbon of green snaking its way across the plain from the general direction of the distant mountains. It marked the path of the stream that flowed down the Staircase into the swamp below.

 We left a cache of supplies near the top of the escarpment. Everything we would need to get back down, ropes with some securely wrapped food, was stored under a small overhang where it would be protected from the weather.

 Everything else -- weapons, camp gear, food, and more of the ever present rope -- went onto our backs. The only break we got was from the stream, which relieved us from the burden of carrying water.

 The plain was flat. Flat enough to force the stream to scurry back and forth across its surface in its never ending attempt to find lower ground. Saratan, however, disdained the laws of gravity and led us straight towards the mountains.

 Or at least as straight as the rock strewn surface would allow. We picked our way around the larger boulders and skirted the edges of gullies. And every half mile or so, when the stream wandered across our path, we slid down the near bank, waded across the shallow water, and climbed the far bank.

 The day felt like summer. The clear skies let the sun warm the land and the air. When a small lake blocked our path, Saratan called a halt and we stripped off our jackets and opened up our clothing in hopes of catching a cooling breeze.

 The little lake blocked our path. To the south the waters lapped up against rock ledges, but to the north they eased into sandy beaches.

 However, we were not alone in thinking the beaches made the better path. Less than a hundred yards from out first stop, Saratan raised her hand. She called Anne forward but we could all see the line of footprints in the sand. Someone had preceded us around the lake.

 Anne, sensing us crowding forward, spread her arms wide to block our path. She kept them spread and walked slowly forward as she studied the footprints.

 Saratan walked with her but her head never bent down. It scanned from side to side as she searched the lakeshore and the path ahead for signs of visitors.

 Anne stopped and pointed out three sets of footprints with big shoes, long strides, and deep impressions. "There's three of them. Bios. And they're heavily loaded."

 "It's Roma," I said. "We're too late." 

 CHAPTER 13

 -- EXPLORERS

 

 The trouble with the desert is the mountains. They erupt abruptly from the plain without benefit of supporting foothills and the black rock blends with the shadows to form a brooding mass that looms over you.

 We followed the stream into a gap between two dark masses. Soon the darkness closed in around us, and we found ourselves in an ever- narrowing canyon bounded with vertical walls of rock. As the canyon narrowed, the bank on the far side of the stream shrank away until the waters lapped directly against the rock wall. On our side of the stream, the waters closed in until we were constrained to scrambling along single file over a thin strip of rock and bush.

 A mile or so into the canyon, it turned sharply and widened into a little basin with a sandy beach. Beyond the beach the bank disappeared altogether and the water poured out through a vertical cleft in the rock. We were at the end of the trail.

 We were not, however, the first visitors on the beach. Footprints covered the sand and near the center small rocks circled ashes of a fire.

 We had developed a routine for this by now. As she always did when we came upon a gypsy campsite, Anne put out her hand, making us stop while she went ahead with Saratan to scour the ground for clues. They poked about, counted footprints, and examined a tree the gypsies had stripped for firewood.

 Saratan put her hand in the ashes. "Cold," was all she said. She had explained before that it meant the gypsies were more than a day ahead.

 "Where did they go?" Anne asked the air.

 We all followed her example and craned our necks back to look up the sheer cliffs that surrounded us. The rock possessed the usual assortment of ledges and cracks, but nothing that offered a path up the thirty or forty feet to the top.

 Saratan waded into the stream and struggled against the current to examine the cleft. Constrained to a channel no more than five feet wide, the hip deep water rippled with speed as it rushed out into the little basin.

 "We can wade up the stream," she said.

 Anne cast a last glance up at the cliffs then nodded. "Let's go," she said and stepped into the water.

 I expected to fight the current when my turn came, but that was not the first problem. As I inched into the water, rings of icy cold sensation rose up my legs, making each step into deeper water an adventure in self-torture.

 Soon however numbness and the struggle against the current made me forget the cold. Saratan led us along the side of the channel where we could find handholds in the rock sides to pull ourselves forward.

 We were lucky. After an initial stretch of hard going, we rounded a bend where the canyon widened letting the water level fall to our thighs and the current ease up. The streambed rose gradually until, after another quarter mile, we emerged from the canyon into a wide valley.

 Tiny and I both pointed to the far end of the valley and said, "There it is!"

 The face of a mountain had fallen away, exposing an expanse of chalky white rock. The cliff was so sheer, so reminiscent of the garage at Farhaven, that we knew immediately that we had found Tower Mech.

 #

 Fresh green grasses smoothed out the rolling swells of land that covered the valley floor. Here and there little clumps of trees hugged the depressions.

 Ahead of us a trail of trampled grass marked the earlier passage of the gypsies through the valley. It pointed straight down the center of the valley towards the base of the cliff.

 We followed the trail, and when we got closer we saw that it led to a city lying at the base of the cliff. But before we reached it, Tiny called a halt and pointed off to the left. "The trail to the garage is over there."

 To the left, a steep slope pushed out from the side of the vertical cliff face. A thin line zigzagged up the slope marking a switchback trail similar to the one at Farhaven.

 We milled about in confusion. If we wanted to go to the garage, we needed to head off to the left. But if we wanted to follow the gypsies, we needed to enter the city.

 Anne looked at me.

 "The gypsies know secrets," I said.

 She nodded. "We'll follow them then."

 The girls expected trouble. They checked their swords and Robyn and Saratan strung their bows and fitted arrows.

 "Candace should be here," I said as we entered the ruined city. Partially collapsed walls and roofs exposed a fortune in rusting iron skeletons to salvage.

 Anne led the way down a broad street. It had once been paved, but now a jungle of weeds overgrew the broken pavement. Anne had no trouble finding enough overturned stones and crushed plants to follow the gypsies.

 They had gone straight down the street and entered a tunnel cut into the cliff.

 #

 Anne spread the girls into a skirmish line but even then we barely occupied the enormous tunnel. It must have been at least thirty feet high and perhaps sixty feet wide. It bored straight back into the mountain until it became lost in darkness.

 We advanced cautiously forward, moving deeper into the mountain as our eyes adjusted to the darkness.

 After a few hundred yards, the tunnel opened into a vast circular chamber. In the semi-darkness we could see shadowy slabs spotted about the chamber floor. Darker shadows in the walls marked a multitude of new tunnels.

 Anne waved us to keep behind while she and Saratan followed the gypsies out onto the floor. Even in the dim light, their path, three sets of footprints, stood out clearly on the dust covered floor. The footprints went straight out onto the floor for about fifty feet then disappeared.

 Anne and then Saratan carefully searched all around the end of the trail before allowing us to come forward. As we got closer we could see that a groove in the floor crossed the gypsies' path where the trail ended. The dust beyond the groove spread out perfectly flat over the floor for about ten feet until it was briefly interrupted by another groove that ran parallel to the first. Beyond that were only more undisturbed dust and the dark hulking shapes.

 "They walked down the groove," Robyn declared.

 "No way," Scribbles said. She managed to put her foot into the groove, but walking was too awkward. You had to pull the back foot up out of the groove, move it around to the front, and place it back into the groove. Staying balanced was impossible, and if you fell, you could break your ankles.

 "We'll look around," Anne said. She waved us back into the skirmish line and started off towards the nearest of the dark slabs.

 When we got closer, I saw wheels holding it above the ground, a double set at the front and another set at the rear. It was a wagon.

 "It's a train," Scribbles said. "The gypsies took a train."

 "What's a train?"

 Scribbles pointed down at the wheels. "See the grooves, they make a track, they had them on Earth."

 I looked suspiciously at Scribbles. True, the wheels seemed locked into the groves, but what good was a wagon that couldn't go anywhere you wanted it? Did the humans really have a book from Earth? After the Elevator was saved, I was going to Calmwater to see it for myself.

 The train was big. It must have been sixty feet long and a dozen feet wide. The wheels were not as big as those on a freight wagon, but they held the train's floor up to chest height. Solid siding, about three feet high made a railing all around the train.

 Anne sent Robyn to the left and Saratan to the right to search around the train, then she locked her hands and let Scribbles step into them. Scribbles stepped from Anne's hands to a little ledge that went around the bottom of the siding. "It's empty," she said and swung her leg over the siding to enter the train.

 "Hey," I said when Anne began scrambling into the train to see for herself. Anne, who was already up on the ledge, dropped back down and boosted me up.

 From the ledge I peered into the train and saw that it was not quite as empty as Scribbles had said. What looked like stools faced outwards at both ends.

 Scribbles followed me to one end of the train. The stool was mounted too close to a low console. When I squeezed myself into the stool, my knees bumped against levers that were mounted on the console.

 "What are these?" Scribbles started fiddling with the levers.

 I squirmed about to get myself comfortable in the seat and looked out along the track. "Well," I said as I pulled on imaginary reins, "if you had some horses, I suppose you could drive from here."

 "Trains didn't need horses," Scribbles said.

 "You have to push?" I decided that she was making it all up.

 The train moved.

 #

 The train picked up speed. Scribbles dropped to her knees and began frantically flipping levers.

 "What are you doing?" I yelled and began pulling her away from the console.

 We entered a tunnel and were plunged into darkness.

 "Let loose," Scribbles shouted back at me. "I've got to find the right lever to stop us."

 I put my hands forward and explored the console. My fingers soon found the row of tiny levers and some larger ones. Did I dare flip them? Scribbles pushed my hands aside.

 Harsh bright light flooded the tunnel. Scribbles flipped a lever up and the light went away. It came back. Scribbles had moved the lever down.

 I noticed a tiny symbol drawn on the console above the lever. I brushed the dust away. The symbol was a circle with rays coming out of it, a miniature sun to control the light.

 "I've tried them all," Scribbles said.

 All the small levers were in the up position, except for the one controlling the light. I flipped it up. The light went out but we kept moving. I flipped it down and the light returned.

 "What about the big levers?"

 "I didn't touch them, I swear."

 I put my hand on the biggest lever. I thought back. "Maybe I bumped this one with my knee." I had touched something. Was this it?

 I pushed the lever upwards: up, at least for the light, seemed to be the off position. This lever was different. It didn't snap between the fully up or fully down positions. Instead it stayed where I pushed it. And as I pushed it up, the train began to pick up speed.

 I pulled it downwards. We slowed, and when the lever was exactly centered, we stopped.

 I pulled the lever down past center and we began to move slowly backwards.

 "Stop," Anne said.

 I centered the lever and the train stopped again. I sighed and the girls made some relieved noises. We had the train under control.

 I looked over the front of the train. The light came from a lamp set into the front of the train. Clearly it was designed to illuminate the track ahead. Fortunately for us, its reflections off the walls also provided a dim illumination inside the car.

 I looked past Anne to the back of the train. The tunnel behind the train was pitch black. "Where's Tiny?" I asked. And Saratan and Robyn?

 #

 The train moved slowly down the track. Too slowly, but Anne would not let me go faster. "Remember what happened in the Maze," she said.

 With half the company and all our gear left back in the chamber under the garage, we could not afford to get lost. Fortunately, the controls at the opposite ends of the train duplicated each other, so we had light to illuminate the tunnel as we attempted to retrace our previous journey.

 Ahead the tunnel widened abruptly on the left and then narrowed again as another tunnel merged with ours. When I stopped the train, Anne and Scribbles climbed down to examine the tracks.

 "Back up," Anne ordered. "We can't see the groves."

 I eased the train backwards until the junction was clear of the wheels but still in the light.

 The train sat in the left-hand branch of a 'Y' formed by the merging tracks. Clearly, on our original run-away journey, we had traveled up the 'Y' and taken the left-hand branch. We needed only to keep going down the 'Y' to return to the chamber.

 We all agreed on the direction, but Anne wanted to mark our path. "Remember the Maze," she kept saying.

 Scribbles had me back the train even deeper into the 'Y' so that she could mark our path. The tunnel lacked the pebbles we had used for marking in the maze, but Scribbles scratched out the number one in the dust a few paces past the junction. "We'll mark a two at the next junction, then three at the one after that," she said. "That way we'll know exactly where we've been if we wander back."

 We were all smiling with confidence and relief when Anne gave the order to start the train, but the next junction shattered our hopes for an easy return. I stopped the train at the bottom of a 'Y'. Two tunnels opened ahead of us. We could have come down either branch.

 Again, Anne and Scribbles got off the train, and they even got down on their knees to examine the grooves, but neither one could detect signs of previous passage.

 "Are we lost already?" I asked.

 Scribbles shook her head. "How could we be? Back up. I want to see the grooves where I know we've been."

 "It's the way the wheels fit into the grooves," she announced after the examination. "They don't disturb the dust."

 The train made our choice for us. When I moved it ahead, it started down the left-hand branch. Anne made me back up and try again. And again the train chose the left-hand branch.

 "Do it again," she commanded. "Try the levers."

 Only one lever on the console moved sideways instead of up and down. It was in the left-hand position, so I flipped it to the right hand position and tried the branch again. This time the train moved to the right.

 "We'll go right," Anne said. "Mark the tunnel, Scribbles."

 This time, we all fretted with worry as we moved down the tunnel.

 #

 The train crawled down the track. The light caught a seam in the tunnel and our eyes tracked it expanding towards us until it disappeared to the rear. Then the light caught another seam, then another.

 "It's been too long," I said. "We should be there." How much time had the runaway journey taken? Surely not this long.

 "We're going slower," Anne said.

 I nudged the lever a tiny bit forward, and when Anne remained silent, I nudged it again. Now the seams rushed towards us.

 Anne must have felt me preparing to nudge the lever again. "Enough," she said. "Be alert, pull back hard if you see anything at all."

 I did as she said, kept my eyes fixed ahead, but the seams kept rushing at us. There seemed to be no end to them.

 After a time, who knows how long, I said, "This can't be the right way."

 "Keep going," Anne said. "We need information."

 "But what about the girls?"

 She sighed and, after a pause, said, "Keep going."

 I shut up. Would the lost girls stay put? Or get in trouble? Was the chance of finding something worth the risk? How could Anne decide?

 Ahead, the seams suddenly veered to the left, so I jerked back on the lever. The train, which had been silent, began emitting a loud, protesting screech. The girls threw out their arms to hold me back as we were thrown forward.

 The train and the screeching and our forward thrust all stopped together. Anything could have happened, but the tunnel was silent, and ahead of us, the track curved harmlessly off to the left.

 "You scared me half to death," Scribbles complained.

 I gulped air. Maybe a little slower would be better. "Following orders," I said.

 I nudged the lever forward and the train began creeping around the curve. Too slow, I decided, but before I could increase our speed, we rounded the curve and entered into a large chamber.

 "We're back," Scribbles said. We all saw the other tunnels exiting from the side and the slab-like shapes of trains that lay scattered about the floor.

 "No. It's different."

 Only four of the circular train tunnels ran from this chamber; the garage chamber had six. And in this chamber, the huge rectangular entrance sloped steeply upwards towards the light; at the garage it had been level.

 #

 I squinted into the light as Anne led us up the entrance slope.

 "It's too bright."

 "We'll get used to it."

 But the light hurt. Squinting and shading my eyes with my hands did no good. The light surrounded me and seemed to come from every direction. Even stopping and turning around to face into the darkness did not help. Bright metallic spots swam across my vision. I couldn't see anything.

 "I'm blind."

 "Wait."

 Slowly the spots faded away and allowed the floor, walls, and ceiling of the tunnel to frame the dark rectangle of the chamber below. When I risked glances to the sides, I saw the girls' backs reflecting silver light. They looked like statues made of polished metal.

 Scribbles stared at me. "Are you okay?"

 "Me? You're the one that looks weird." Her face was made of metal too. And, I discovered, my hands and body too. Everything glowed with the silver light.

 "Come on," Anne said.

 This time as we went forward, I could see past her, out past the tunnel walls, into a plaza surrounded with low buildings. The silver light came from beyond the buildings, from a distant surface. It dimmed to the sides and was almost dark towards our rear, but it completely surrounded us.

 Something, a presence at the edge of my vision, drew my eyes upwards. The silver surface rose straight into the heavens. We were at the bottom of an immense tube.

 "We're in the Elevator," Scribbles said.

 We were at infinity. I couldn't stop staring upwards into the never ending tube.

 "Well, we know something about the trains now," Anne said. "We better get back to the girls."

 "But it's the Elevator," I protested. "We've got to look around."

 I did look around. The low buildings around the plaza blocked our view, but I could see taller structures spreading out into the distance. I had no true reference for judging distance, but the Elevator wall seemed miles away.

 The light dimmed.

 "What's that?"

 Darkness began creeping up the bright side of the Elevator. We were not really in shadow, the light came from everywhere, but the girls lost their metallic glow and became merely pale.

 "It's sunset," Scribbles said. "That's why the Elevator is brighter on the one side. It's the sun shinning through."

 "Come on," Anne said. "We've got no time."

 #

 I eased the train into the chamber and stopped. The light from the train became lost in the vast space, so we counted tunnels by sensing spots of greater darkness in the gloom.

 "I see four," I said.

 "Maybe six," Anne said.

 Scribbles, who couldn't see anything, looked down. "Are those footprints?" she asked.

 They were everywhere, coming and going on both sides of the track.

 "Hello!" Anne shouted.

 The chamber swallowed her greeting and returned only silence.

 "Back up," Anne said.

 As the train crept backwards, the pool of light from the lamp showed a line of footsteps between the tracks. In my mind I could picture desperate girls running down the tunnel chasing after our runaway train.

 "Stop." Anne commanded.

 A wide area of trampled and kicked up dust marked where the girls had milled about before returning to the chamber.

 "Good," Anne said. "At least they're not wandering around in the tunnels."

 "Unless they took a train," Scribbles said.

 I didn't even want to think about that; we were all silent.

 When we reached the chamber, Anne had an idea. "Move the train so it lights the entrance. Let's see if they went outside."

 I guided the train forward over the crisscrossing tracks until light from the lamp flooded over the entrance floor.

 Anne jumped down and scouted the dust. "They have gone out," she said. "Stay here, I'll see if I can find them."

 Anne quickly disappeared beyond the light. Twice we heard her call out to the other girls but heard nothing after that. We stared into the night and waited for some sign.

 "What's keeping them?" Scribbles asked.

 They should be back, I thought. "Let's go find them."

 "Anne said wait," Scribbles said.

 More time passed. My eyes began to imagine movement in the darkness but the shadows were made of nothing.

 "I'm hungry."

 "Wait."

 "I'm thirsty."

 "Wait."

 After a while, Scribbles sat on the floor of the train and leaned against the siding. I got off the control chair and snuggled against her.

 I brushed a strand of Scribbles's hair from my face. Scribbles had not been aggressive about making a marriage. Perhaps I had resisted too hard. I'll have to help her out. I nuzzled closer to her cheek but my eyelids were heavy. I'll just let her rest a bit first.

 #

 "Wake up, wake up." Tiny pushed on my shoulder until I opened my eyes. "We got breakfast," she said.

 Scribbles and I kicked at each other until our legs untangled. And the blanket was in the way. Where did it come from anyway?

 Tiny put a cup of oatmeal in my hands. It was too hot. And she hadn't watered it down enough: it stuck in my throat as I swallowed. "Yuk," I said. "Where were you?"

 "You were asleep when we got back," she said as she gave Scribbles her oatmeal.

 In the morning light from the entrance I could see Robyn and Saratan sitting near Anne. They were making faces at their breakfasts, drinking coffee, and making plans. No one seemed interested in explaining herself.

 "Roma could have gone into any of the tunnels," Anne said. "We'll have to try them all."

 Saratan shook her head, "That'll take too long."

 "What else can we do?"

 I spoke up. "We should try the garage."

 "What about the gypsies?" Anne asked.

 "They gave the memory to Tower Mech."

 "I meant Roma. Why didn't she go there?"

 "Maybe she doesn't know. Tower Mech would have kept the memory in the garage."

 Chasing after Roma had been a mistake. We needed to get ahead of her, needed to beat her to the memory. 

 CHAPTER 14

 -- GHOSTS

 

 The trouble with mechanicals is that they live on top of mountains. That was their business, of course, but it seemed to me that they ought to be willing to come down and fly visitors up, instead of making them hike all the way. I slid my thumbs under the straps to give my shoulders relief from the backpack and listened to the girls talk.

 "We didn't know what to do," Saratan was saying as we trudged up the path. The exertion made her sound a bit breathless. "We ran after the train, but the tunnel was too dark... so we decided to wait, but there was no water... so we went outside."

 "That was fine," Anne said. "But we should work out a way of finding each other."

 "We could leave notes," Robyn said.

 Scribbles snorted. "Got paper?"

 "Then draw arrows on the ground," Saratan said.

 "What sort of arrows?"

 "Where should we put them?"

 You would think the girls would want to save their breath, but no, they discussed crazy schemes all the way to the garage. If they had asked me, which they didn't, I would have told them the obvious solution: don't get split up. Then you wouldn't have to worry about it.

 #

 I sneezed and scowled at the backs of the girls. They had gotten ahead of me and were kicking up the dust with their passage. For some reason, the dust in the tunnel was finer than that in the train chambers. The inch thick layer must have lain there undisturbed for centuries. At least it proved we had beaten the gypsies to the garage.

 Like the Farhaven garage, the tunnel grew dark then light to finally open up onto a ledge overlooking a crater. A similar system of ramps and tunnel openings covered the crater walls, and a small lake covered much of the crater floor. But unlike Farhaven, islands of green scum floated on the water. No mechanicals tended the tank farm; no flames rose from the vats.

 Anne put the girls right to work: Robyn scouted the lakeshore for fresh water; Scribbles set up camp and started lunch; and Saratan and Anne helped Tiny search the caves.

 I strolled along the edge of the lake. In the distance I could hear the girls working and calling to each other, but the crater walls muffled the sounds and imposed an eerie silence along the shoreline. In the water I could see the flat boulders where the mechanicals used to lie. When I didn't look directly at the rocks, I could imagine sensors tracking me.

 The Farhaven garage had been filled with excitement and possibilities, but this forlorn place held only ghosts. I shook my head but couldn't cast off the images until shouts from across the lake interrupted my thoughts.

 Tiny stood in front of a small tunnel waving her hands and shouting about having found something. I hurried around the lake, but the girls, who were closer, reached the tunnel first. Anne, then Robyn followed Tiny inside.

 "Wait for me," I shouted and began running to close the distance before they all disappeared.

 "Hurry up," Scribbles said as she turned to follow Robyn into the tunnel.

 I caught up and entered behind her, but I couldn't see anything except her backside, so I grabbed her blouse and let her lead me forward.

 "Where are we going?" I asked, but got no answer.

 As my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I began to sense the walls pressing in towards us. Unlike the expansive mechanical tunnels, this tunnel was little more than a shoulder wide passage roughly cut into the raw rock. Past the dark shadows of the girls, I saw dim light that marked the end of the tunnel.

 As we stepped from the tunnel, the light drew my eyes upwards. A faint glow came from shafts bored into the cavern ceiling, but a series of broad ledges seemed to soak up the light as they stepped sharply down the cavern walls. No light at all reached our feet: the cavern floor was a pool of blackness.

 "What is this place?" I asked.

 "It's the service bay," Tiny said. I saw her hand pitch something out into the blackness and heard the sound of a splash. Black ripples spread out to reveal a pond set in the cavern floor. "That's the mechanicals' dive," she said.

 As Tiny led us around the pond, I stayed well away from the dark waters. I didn't even want to think about what might be in there.

 "It's Tower Mech," Tiny announced.

 The mechanical lay in the brighter light of a service alcove. A detached leg still swung from an overhead hoist. Tools of unknown purpose were scattered about, and pipes connected several wheeled tanks to the body.

 I reached out to stroke a rear leg, but my hand jerked away. The once smooth surface was pitted and flaked with corrosion. And when I ran my hand over the body, it too was rough to the touch. The dull copper skin lacked even a hint of translucence.

 At the front of the mechanical, lifeless sensors hung from drooping stalks. Saratan and Anne knelt on the ground brushing dust and debris from the manipulators.

 Saratan looked carefully at the manipulators and searched the ground around them. Then she reported to Anne with a shake of her head. "Just tools and rusted parts. Nothing that could be memory or keys."

 #

 "Maybe its not in the crater," Tiny said.

 "No kidding."

 Robyn dumped another log onto the campfire. It kicked up a flurry of angry red sparks, but no one complained. A day spent searching the garage had produced exactly nothing. We all felt like throwing things.

 Except for Anne. I could see the sparks reflecting from her eyes as she fixed them on Tiny. "What do you mean?" she asked.

 "Well at Farhaven, there was this landing ledge that I couldn't clean, I could see it from one of the other ledges, but no tunnels led to it. When I asked the Mechanic, she said not to worry about it. Maybe it was a private place for the mechanicals, maybe there is one here too."

 "Now you tell us," Robyn groaned.

 Anne stared into the fire and chewed on her lip. "We'll give it a try in the morning, but if we find nothing, we're going to have to chase down the gypsies."

 #

 Anne fastened a rope around herself and went to the edge. I held the rope tightly as she used it to lean out away from the cliff. "There's Saratan," she said, pointing to the north.

 Earlier, Anne had split the company to search the ledges. Robyn took Scribbles to the south ledge; Saratan took Tiny to the north; and Anne took me to the center.

 Twisting around to look south Anne said, "I can see a ledge over there." Then, after a moment, "Robyn is on it now."

 After that she carefully examined the cliff, looking above and below us. After a bit she stopped and fixed her gaze on the heights above us. "There could be something up there."

 #

 I forced my eyes up from the valley floor. Here from the top of the crater rim we could see out past the guard mountains to the plain beyond. In the distance I could just make out the Spire at Towerhold rising above the horizon.

 Robyn turned me around and put the rope harness on me. "It's just like the practice at Towerhold," she said.

 Only here, a thousand feet above the valley floor, a fall would not mean a spill into lake water.

 Holding onto the rope for balance I backed over the crater edge and began walking down the cliff, matching my pace to the rate that Robyn let the rope play out. Scribbles was lying at the edge, peering over to watch my descent. I kept my eyes focused on her until Anne grabbed my arm and drew me onto the landing ledge.

 I joined Anne, Saratan, and Tiny at the back of a ledge that already felt crowded. It lacked the usual grand entrance cave; instead a small landing pad was scooped out of the cliff face and connected directly to a tunnel that disappeared into blackness.

 "Come on," Tiny said. Holding a torch she led us into the tunnel, which opened up into a small cavern.

 "There they are," she said, pointing to a ledge carved into the walls. We were surrounded by manipulator claws. There must have been a dozen of the massive claws, all carefully arranged to point into the center of the cavern.

 I approached one claw, attracted by reflections from the torchlight. Jewels lay scattered in the dust under it, some still attached to the decayed remains of what I took to be a flight harness. I began picking up the stones -- an emerald, a ruby, something blue...

 "Don't!" Tiny stood next to me.

 "I was just looking." It wasn't grave robbing: mechanicals weren't people. But Tiny was upset, so I put the stones back under the claw.

 We followed the ledge around the cavern. The jeweled claw was not alone. Each guarded a treasure: mostly jewels but other artifacts as well -- objects of gold and silver and even some of stone and wood. Tiny speculated that each mechanical was buried with something it had prized in life. If so, I wondered, what sort of stories lay buried here? Why would a mechanical prize a sword? Or a round egg shaped stone?

 "Hey maybe this is it!" Tiny was pointing at the ledge where the row of manipulator claws ended. There setting in an empty spot where the next claw -- Tower Mech's claw -- would be placed, was a box like object.

 We all recognized it. It was one of the boxes from the Spire, the ones that filled the cabinets in the Beast's lair.

 #

 "Be careful," I shouted upwards to where Scribbles leaned out over the precipice.

 I needn't have. Scribbles used the extension of her arms to keep the memory away from the cliff face. She methodically gathered the rope in hand over hand and pulled the memory all the way to the top without once banging it against the rock.

 I sighed when she disappeared from view. Good. The memory is up. That part's done.

 We waited.

 Sweaty palms. I wiped them against my shirt. My turn next.

 "We're ready," I shouted up to the empty ledge.

 Take deep breaths. It passes the time and keeps you from panting. Don't look down. And stop thinking about not looking.

 "Sometime today would be nice." Come on. Let's get it over with.

 At last, a coil of rope came flying over the edge. It sailed out into space spinning and unwinding until the last loop played out. Then the strand fell back towards us and Anne reached out her hand to snag it.

 "Just like coming down," Anne said as she made the rope into a harness around me. "Keep your weight back."

 I nodded.

 "Ready," she shouted upwards. She gave the rope a sharp tug, and as they drew up the slack, she helped me get my feet started on the walk up the cliff.

 I risked a glance up, but no one was visible on the rim. So I kept my eyes fixed on the rock and let the rope carry me upwards until my eyes cleared the edge and saw a hand reaching for me.

 That was not so bad, I thought, but the relief lasted only a brief moment. The hand was not a friendly hand. I looked past it into the scowling face of Captain Roma. 

 CHAPTER 15

 -- KIDNAPPERS

 

 The trouble with surprises is that you don't know what to do. When Roma reached for my arm, I threw myself to the side. Immediately my feet skidded out from under me, and the rope pulled me into the cliff face, causing my hip and shoulder to slam hard into the rock.

 Before I could recover, Roma grabbed my collar and jerked me onto the ledge where she held me in the air with my feet barely touching the ground. The shirt pulled tight around my neck and choked me, and when I kicked at her legs, she shook me hard. "Be still," she commanded.

 "Let me go," I croaked.

 Her free hand searched at my pockets. "Where are the cards?"

 "They're mine." I gathered the cloth above the cards into my fist and held on tight so that she couldn't force her hand into my pocket.

 "He has them," she said and gave up digging for the cards.

 Instead she began pulling me towards the ramp leading down into the crater. I tried dragging my feet, but she simply held me into the air so that they kicked uselessly above the ground.

 When I looked around for something to grab onto, I saw the girls. Scribbles face was bloody and she was kneeling over Robyn who was doubled over into a ball grasping at her stomach. I lost sight of them as Roma carried me down the ramp.

 I twisted about to see where we were going. The woman that Roma called Bosun led the way and carried the memory. The other woman, Mate, held a sword in one hand and clutched the other to a bloody wound in her side.

 Roma was strong, but not so strong that she could carry me one-handed forever. She lowered me to my feet and made me walk alongside her by jerking me hard whenever I tried to hold back. Unfortunately, the rope, which was still tied to me, dragged behind and snagged on the rocks.

 "Hey," I cried.

 It wasn't fair to get jerked when I didn't do anything. But Roma didn't care: she kept jerking until I got the rope untied and was able to keep up.

 She dragged me through the garage and into the entrance tunnel. When we reached daylight, Roma pushed me into a corner. "Sit down and don't move," she ordered.

 Their packs were there, leaning against the cliff where they had cached them. While Roma helped Mate lie down, Bosun up-ended one of the packs and spilled the contents onto the ground. She grabbed a sewing kit and began stitching up Mate's side, while Roma sopped up the blood with a bandage.

 I was trapped. The gypsies were between the tunnel and me and the path leading down the mountain was beyond that. I looked upwards but couldn't see anything. The girls were trapped too, somewhere up there in the burial cave. Would Scribbles be able to pull them out? And what about Robyn? Was she dead?

 #

 When the sewing was done, Roma wrapped the bandage around Mate's waist while Bosun began stuffing gear back into the spilled pack. We were going to move again. Somehow, I needed to delay them until the girls caught up.

 "Here let me help you," I said as I drug a pack to the cliff edge.

 "You little shit," Bosun screamed as I pushed it over. The pack fell free for perhaps a hundred feet then struck the cliff and bounced out into space.

 Bosun grabbed my arm with one hand and raised the other into the air. I ducked and closed my eyes, but the blow never came. Instead she pulled me away from the cliff and growled at me. "I ought to smack you good."

 "Let it go," Roma said. She pushed the memory into my chest. "Carry this."

 When I glanced towards the cliff, she shrugged and smugly hefted a pack onto her back. If the memory hadn't been too important, I would have thrown it over just to prove she wasn't so smart.

 Bosun started down the trail. She had a pack on her back and one arm around Mate. Roma pushed me ahead of her.

 What was the girls' scheme for marking our path? Something about making arrows. But how could I do that without Roma seeing me? I would have to do something else.

 I stumbled and went down to my knees. Roma jerked me to my feet. "Keep moving," she warned.

 "Quit pushing." I cringed, expecting the worse, but she hadn't caught me. When the trail started to curve, I risked a glance backwards.

 The card lay in the middle of the trail where I had dropped it. The girls would see it there -- but only if they escaped the cave.

 #

 "Hold up," Bosun said as she lowered Mate to the ground.

 Crimson stains soaked the Mate's bandage and trickled down her leg. And when Bosun pulled the bandage off, I could see tears in the skin where the stitches had ripped free.

 "You're killing her," I said. "She shouldn't be walking."

 "Be quiet." Roma stood and stared down the valley towards the city at the base of the cliff. We were just at the base of the trail and had only a quarter mile to go. We both looked back up the trail towards the garage, but saw no signs of pursuit.

 Roma knelt back down and helped Bosun redo the stitches and bandage. "We'll carry her to the trains. She'll be okay."

 "I can make it," Mate said, but her voice was strained and weak. And her face was pale and sweaty. Amin had looked like that before she died.

 The Bosun chopped down two small trees and they used a blanket to make a stretcher. When they put Mate onto the stretcher, I added the memory to their load. "It's too heavy," I complained.

 I started breathing deeply and got ready. Roma and Bosun hefted their packs onto their backs, picked up the stretcher, and started towards the city.

 I ran. Not towards the city, that's where they wanted to go. And not back up the trail to the garage, they would trap me there. I sprinted up the valley and headed towards the woods.

 I heard curses and shouts behind me, but I didn't look back. A hundred yards to go. Seventy-five. I heard footsteps behind me. Fifty yards. A hand grabbed my shirt and pulled me to a stop.

 Roma, who was also gasping for breath, let me drop to my knees. The woods, I saw, were not even close. And when I looked upwards towards the garage, I could see no sign of the girls.

 #

 "You're dead," I claimed. "The farmers hang bandits."

 I did not want to be near Roma, but she was guiding the train through the tunnels. So I stood at the front of the train and thought up ways to berate and threaten her. She was so intent on ignoring me that she never noticed me dropping cards onto the tracks whenever the tunnel forked.

 Fortunately I did not have to worry about Bosun. She was sitting next to Mate, holding her hand and occasionally fussing with the bandage.

 "We're here," Roma announced as she stopped the train. To our left, the tunnel widened out to form a platform next to the train. Past the platform, steps led upwards.

 She made me get off the train and took me to the stairs where she tied my feet together and my hands behind me. "Be quiet," she said, "or I'll stuff a dirty sock in your mouth."

 #

 Pain in my feet and hands woke me. Roma sat nearby, biting at a strip of jerky. Beyond her, Bosun maintained a watch over the prone figure of Mate. Packs and gear lay scattered about. The train was hidden behind the glare from its light.

 I moaned as I tried to sit up. Roma untied my hands, and when I was upright, she gave me a strip of jerky.

 I accepted without thinking and was already chewing on it before it occurred to me that I shouldn't be accepting things from an enemy. Of course, hunger would have forced me to eat eventually, but I should have resisted. At least she had the decency to not attempt conversation.

 After a while, Roma and Bosun got up and hefted their packs onto their backs. Mate did not move at all.

 "Are you going to leave her?"

 "She's dead." Roma pulled me to my feet and handed the memory to me.

 Light from above cast an orange glow over the stairs, and as we neared the top, the light separated into golden beams shining down into a vast space. We stepped out onto the floor to join a ceremony rendered in stone -- women and a beast greeting a mechanical.

 I gasped. "We're in the Spire."

 "Yes," Roma said.

 "But why?"

 Roma dropped her eyes to the memory and tapped it with her finger. "In here is the whole of ancient knowledge. We need to learn what we can before the Elevator falls."

 "You can't learn anything in a day or two." She had no idea what she was saying. The library at Towerhold already held more knowledge than any one person could learn in a lifetime. It would take a thousand lifetimes to learn what the ancients knew.

 "Perhaps." She nodded. "But there's the Elevator. We have to make sure we can escape the devastation."

 I gave up trying to reason with her. She was mad.

 #

 In some ways the trip was like before. The endless steps and the cramps and the struggle to get moving after a stop were the same. Only this time I had no one to rub my legs. I sat on the steps and tended to myself while Roma and Bosun helped each other. And this time, the scary anticipation of that first climb was replaced with a dreadful foreboding. The bloody image of Scribbles working over a motionless Robyn burned in my mind.

 Another difference was the darkness. When Roma's last torch sputtered out, she pulled me forward and made me lead the way. I kept one arm around the memory and one hand on the wall as I felt my way upwards. Roma kept the back of my shirt wrapped in her fist. Whenever I went too slowly, she pushed her fist into my back, and when I went too fast, she tugged at the shirt.

 We slept in one of the side passages. Roma tied me again and made me sleep near the ledge so that I would have to crawl over them to escape.

 From my position near the ledge, I could see the eastern sky. The Elevator had taken on a wicked look. The silver sheen had turned to a lifeless gray. And the curve, which began lower than I had ever seen it, had taken on a double bend. Lower down it veered off to the south but higher up it reversed itself and tailed off to the north. Soon it would come crashing down.

 #

 Time meant nothing on the stairs. Climb, push and tug, rest and then do it all over forever.

 When we reached the open stairs near the top, I didn't even think much about the long fall to the world below. I did notice that the shadows were short. That meant noon. Roma would stop when we got to the top. The possibility of rest, and Roma's fist in my back, propelled me forward.

 We rounded the curve of the Spire.

 "Captain," Bosun shouted.

 Roma did not reply, but she released my shirt, and I heard the singing of swords being draw from their scabbards. Keeping my hand against the cliff, I turned inwards to look over my shoulder.

 Saratan! She was coming up the stairs and Anne was right behind her.

 For the moment, Roma and Bosun seemed to have forgotten me. They faced downwards with their swords drawn, their attention focused on the advancing humans.

 I quietly backed up the steps then turned and began hurrying upwards. If I could reach the maze, I could hide.

 But Roma knew too well my value as a shield. I managed only a few yards before she ran me down and seized my shirt collar.

 When I was jerked backwards, the memory slipped out of my hands and fell heavily to the steps. As it skidded towards the edge, I reached out and just managed to slap it towards the cliff before Roma dragged me away.

 I forgot the memory, leaving it to its fate as I confronted my own. Roma swung me around and held me out at the edge as she marched me down the steps towards Bosun. I tried to crowd in close to her, but she used her grip on my collar to keep me away from her, to keep me out at the edge where I would fall if she released me.

 She was too late to save Bosun. Saratan, who had closed within sword- length of Bosun, suddenly dropped low revealing Anne who stood behind her with drawn bow.

 The twang of the string, the thud of the arrow's impact, and the grunt from Bosun came so close together as to be one sound. Simultaneous with the sound, the bloody head of the arrow popped out from Bosun's back.

 Immediately, Saratan rose and pushed her sword into Bosun's neck. She used it not to kill, Bosun was already dying, but to clear the path. As she pushed, Bosun's body fell outwards and went over the edge. She fell soundlessly downwards.

 "Stay back," Roma warned when Saratan advanced on her. She emphasized her words by holding me even farther over the edge.

 "Would you die a coward?" Saratan challenged. She meant to kill Roma: you could see it in her eyes, but she halted her advance with her sword inches from Roma's.

 Roma's only reply was to step backwards, taking me with her. Saratan followed with a step forward. Step by step we backed upwards with Saratan pressing us with matching steps.

 I could do nothing, but flail around. However, when my hand brushed her blouse, I gathered the loose material into my fist and held on tight. If she let me go, I would take her with me.

 The memory killed Roma. It lay there on the steps forgotten by everybody until she stepped backwards and stumbled on it. She fell heavily and when the back of her head hit the steps, she lost her grip on my collar.

 I landed on my stomach with my hips and legs over the edge. The breath whooshed out of me, but I clawed frantically at Roma's blouse and pulled my body tight against her. Roma's body shuttered and I felt a burning pain in my forearm. Saratan had run us both through: her sword sliced through my arm and buried itself into Roma's gut.

 We struggled. Saratan's sword grated into the steps beneath us as she leaned on it and tried to pin us to the rock. Roma, who must have known she was dead, tried to push me off, tried to roll me towards the edge. But I hugged at her and would not let loose even though she was coughing blood into my face.

 #

 What was Saratan looking so pale for? I was the one who was bleeding. All she had to do was sew up my arm.

 "Be still," she said.

 I tried to stop kicking my feet. At first, it had been more sickening than painful: once the flesh flapped away from my forearm, and I saw a flash of blood-stained ivory deep in the wound. But by the time Saratan got me to the top of the stairs and laid me down in the gravel, the arm hurt so much that it brought tears to my eyes.

 "Some rescue," I complained. "You're supposed to slice up the bad girls, not me."

 Anne leaned over me. "We have your cards."

 "Well, you better not have lost any." I took the cards and clutched them to my chest.

 When Saratan finished sewing, she tied on a bandage and gently adjusted my arm so that it rested across my stomach. "That's the best I can do, we'll get Scribbles to look at it."

 "Are they hurt bad?" I asked.

 "They'll be okay," Anne said. "But we'll be able to open our own hospital, Robyn got beat up and Scribbles's head split open."

 "I thought Robyn was dead."

 "We left them back at the garage with Tiny, I'll go get them, Saratan will stay here with you." 

 CHAPTER 16

 -- BEASTS

 

 The trouble with girls is they like to sleep too much. When I pushed on the pots, they fell off the rock and rolled to the ground with a satisfying clatter, but just to be sure, I kicked them too.

 The girls jumped up from their bedrolls and instantly crouched into fighting postures as they looked wildly around.

 Startled by the unexpected ferocity of their reaction, I stepped backwards and, accidentally this time, kicked a pot. I felt their eyes dart first to the pot, then shift upwards to my face. I tried to look innocent. "Sorry, I tripped."

 The girls, all of them I think, groaned. And when they looked up and saw the early dawn sky, they began returning to their bedrolls.

 "Hey, it's morning," I said as I picked up a pot. "I'll fetch water. Someone start a fire."

 The girls groaned again, but as I dipped the pot into the lake, I heard Scribbles striking flint against her knife blade. And as I lugged the water back to the fire, I saw the other girls begin their chores.

 They moved so sluggishly that I felt a twinge of guilt. Perhaps I should have let them rest. Shortly before sundown the previous day, they had arrived exhausted from the long climb up the Spire. Anne had made the climb twice, and Scribbles and Robyn were hampered by injuries, so they all had need of rest.

 But after lying around the camp for four days, I was charged with energy. After breakfast, we would restore the memory and summon the Beast. Everything -- the hardships of travel, the courtship with humans, the battles with bandits and gypsies -- the whole adventure would be proven worthwhile today.

 I added water to my oatmeal until it was soupy enough to swallow. That, I decided, is the real trouble with adventure. On the trail, oatmeal is about all you can carry for breakfast, but even on a good morning, it's hard to swallow, and when you're excited, it's impossible.

 "How's your arm?" Anne asked.

 "Fine," I answered hoping she wasn't thinking about waiting until it healed. Scribbles, I knew, was worried about the infection, but Saratan had put the arm in a sling, and as long as I didn't move too much, it didn't hurt too badly.

 "All right, we'll do it." Anne glanced at the bandage on Scribbles's head. "Saratan and Robyn can open it up."

 #

 Once again, the Beast's door groaned and rumbled back from the entrance. Even before it swung fully open, Saratan and Robyn, dripping wet and shivering from cold, slipped out and pushed past us to get their clothes.

 We let them pass and stared into the Beast's lair. Everything seemed the same as before: rows of cabinets outlined in the dim red glow from their lights.

 Tiny said, "Come on."

 She carried the memory into the lair and headed straight to the big cabinet with the missing box. When she held the memory up to the hole and turned it all around, we could see that the memory was meant to be inserted into the hole. However, the hole itself was cluttered with dust and debris: some small animal had once used it for a nest.

 Tiny carefully scraped all the loose material from the hole then cleaned it with a rag. Afterwards she gently inserted the memory into the hole and slid it inwards until it stopped. It stuck out just a fraction of an inch more than the other boxes.

 "Careful," Scribbles cautioned.

 Tiny removed the memory and we re-inspected it and the hole. We could spot no damage or obstructions, so she reinserted it. Again it stopped, still sticking out a bit more than the other boxes.

 "Push harder," I said.

 We all held our breath as Tiny increased her pressure on the box. A loud click made us jump, but the box popped into place, seated fully into the hole level with the other boxes.

 Several red lights appeared on the box. They blinked a few times, which seemed to set off a chorus of answering blinks from the other cabinets. But it lasted only for a brief moment, then all the lights settled back into a steady glow.

 "Have a look around," Anne commanded the girls.

 They quickly spread out and checked between the rows of cabinets, looked in the mechanicals' dive, and even went outside.

 "Nothing," they said when they returned.

 The Beast had not appeared.

 #

 "You didn't put it in right," Scribbles said.

 Tiny walked to the cabinet and stared at the memory. "It's working, see the lights, there's nowhere else it could go."

 "Well, what about the keys?" Scribbles asked.

 Anne shook her head. "We looked everywhere."

 "The gypsies took them."

 "No. We searched them."

 "Well, there aren't any locks anyway."

 "Maybe it's dead," Scribbles said.

 Silence greeted her remark. No one had dared say that before, but the idea possessed a grim weight. Centuries had passed since the Beast was last summoned. Perhaps the whole expedition had been based on wishful thinking.

 "Maybe it doesn't matter," Tiny said. "Maybe everything is fixed."

 "How would we know?"

 "Hey, we didn't search Bosun. Maybe she had the keys. We could fish her out of the lake."

 Leaving the rehashing of events to the girls, I walked outside. One thing I had accomplished during four days of waiting was to learn my way around the maze: a five-minute stroll took me to the western rim of the Spire.

 The land below me remained shrouded in darkness, but the distant mountains poked frosty peaks into the rising sun. And as the light crept down the Rincon mountains, I saw, or perhaps imagined, the even more distant peaks protecting Farhaven valley.

 What would I be doing now if I had stayed? Raising pigs, probably. And regretting, almost certainly, not going on my quest. It had not been all that bad. I had learned some things, been some places, and found the girls.

 I would have been satisfied with that, except that I could still feel the Elevator's ominous presence behind my shoulder. Now, after having been inside the Elevator, my mind formed a clear picture of how the fall would unfold. The tube, miles in diameter, would come crashing down crushing everything in its path. And the force of the fall would send a storm of destruction out for dozens, perhaps hundreds, of miles to either side.

 And the destruction wouldn't stop at the Rincons or even Farhaven. Scribbles said that the Elevator reached to what she called synchronous orbit, making it long enough to wrap completely around the planet as it fell. All life around the equator -- and on Snowshoe everything lived at the equator -- was at risk.

 I withdrew the cards from my pocket. The girls had found all the cards I dropped to mark my trail. I was glad of that. I leafed slowly through the deck, looking for guidance.

 The bandit Amin had paid me to tell her fortune. But after I had turned up the cards and had seen into her future, I had returned her silver, refusing to be a conduit of misfortune. 'Plans Coming To Nothing' had been her fate. Perhaps her violent death had attached some of the bad portends to me.

 I flipped the cards over one by one, rubbing my fingers gently over the edges and looking anew at the colorful designs drawn on the face of each card: the amber warmth of the Kettle, comfort and family; and the emerald scrolls of the Beginnings, the uncertainties of new ventures.

 The flow of cards produced a familiar harmony; a harmony broken by a stranger -- the Ancestor card. Why, after forcing it on me, had Roma tried to take my other cards?

 The next card was the Beast.

 #

 "What's wrong," Tiny shouted as I rushed past the camp.

 Nothing was wrong, but I was too busy to explain. As I passed, the girls, who had returned to the camp for coffee, looked up with alarmed expressions. Behind me, I heard coffee cups being dropped and swords being drawn.

 At the lair, I stood before the doorway panting to catch my breath and trying to think. First, I wanted to compare the design on the Beast card with the design on the door.

 I stepped inside and pushed on the knob that controlled the door, and as it began swinging closed, I retreated outside.

 "Why did you do that?" Robyn asked. "The dive's not that much fun."

 "So we'll use a key," I said. My eyes shifted between card and door. The designs matched exactly.

 "But there aren't any locks."

 "Think. The fems. They weren't blacksmiths. They didn't use primitive locks."

 The first time we had visited the lair, Robyn had probed the door with her knife. So now I knelt before the door and searched until I found a thin slot disguised in the carvings that formed the Beast's mouth. The Beast Card fit edgewise into the slot, so I slid it in until it seated.

 The door rumbled away from me as it swung open.

 #

 "Hey, how did you do that?" Tiny asked.

 "So you girls better start treating me better," I warned them.

 "Huh?"

 "Roma said I was a gypsy prince. That's how I got the cards. They're the missing keys." No wonder Roma had been so interested in them. She had known that they were the keys.

 Anne, however, was not impressed with my claims to royalty. When I tried to enter the lair, she stopped me with a hand on my shoulder. "Check it out, Saratan."

 So much for rank. I had to wait until the girls swept through the lair and pronounced it safe.

 "Nothing's changed," Saratan reported.

 Life wasn't fair. We had the memory and, now, the keys. Where was the Beast? I wandered around, examining the cabinets, the floor, the ceiling. Looking for... looking for what?

 Eventually, I found it, a slot for a key card, in one of the cabinets. Something seemed to be etched into the metal over the slot, so I blew away the dust and rubbed at the dirt until I recognized the design -- the Elevator.

 To be sure, I shuffled through the deck to find the card and held it up to the cabinet.

 "What's he doing?" Tiny asked.

 "The card!" Scribbles answered. "It has the same design as the tile."

 The designs did match, so I inserted the Elevator Card into the slot. When the card seated, the cabinet lights flashed and blinked rapidly. After a moment, the lights in an adjacent cabinet began blinking, and soon every cabinet in that row became active. But the other rows remained dormant, and the Beast didn't show.

 "Look for other locks," Anne told the girls.

 They spread out and soon began calling me to other cabinets. The results were always the same: when the correct key card was inserted, the lights would flash; an incorrect key card would produce no effect.

 Finally, when the girls could find no more locks, Anne walked around the lair. "Every row is unlocked," she said.

 "I have lots of cards left," I announced.

 "Which ones?" Scribbles asked. She began brushing dust off the central table. "Lay them out here."

 I spread the cards onto the tabletop and sorted into proper order. "I have all the minor cards and four majors."

 "What does that mean?" Scribbles asked.

 "The minor cards, the ones with numbers, might not be keys."

 "And the majors?"

 "I've still got the Ancestor, Traveler, Mech, and Seeker."

 Anne picked up the Mech Card and gave it to Saratan. "Search for this design."

 While Anne passed out the remaining major cards, I scooped up the minors. However as I gathered them in, my eyes caught a hint of design under the dust. We had been staring at the cards so intently that we had failed to look at the table itself.

 "Help me," I said as I wiped at the dust.

 Even before the table was completely clean, Robyn held up her card. "It's this one."

 "The Seeker," I said.

 The girls brushed at the dirt and searched the table, until they found the lock, a slot in the side of the slab. Taking the Seeker from Robyn, I knelt before the slot and inserted the card.

 "What's that!" shouted Tiny.

 Instantly, Anne snatched me away from the table and Saratan drew her sword as she sprang in front of us.

 "Hey," I complained, then fell silent as I looked past the girls.

 It was the Beast. Or more accurately, the Beast's ghost. A wispy pale image of the monster's head hung over the table. We could see right through it to the cabinets beyond.

 The point of Saratan's sword was a determined warning inches from the Beast's face. Pale blue eyes stared coldly back, facing the company down. Nobody moved.

 Finally Robyn said, "I don't think it sees us."

 Saratan slowly pushed her sword forward. It went through the Beast without effect. Robyn was right. The Beast was motionless, seemingly unaware of us.

 My eyes dropped to the table. A button sat below the slot holding the Seeker card. But when I reached for it, Anne held out her arm, blocking me from the table. "Get out of the way," I said.

 "Wait, we don't know what's going on here."

 "No, I want to try something." I reached past her arm and pushed the button, feeling it move.

 Instantly Anne put her arms around me and dragged me away from the table. I could see why. The Beast was moving. The pale blue eyes darkened to a cobalt intensity as it examined each of us in turn. It was definitely alive now.

 "Ecce homo," it said.

 "What?"

 I should have stayed quiet. The eyes fixed on me. I could feel Anne, who still had me in her grasp, tense her muscles, getting ready for action. Saratan moved closer, her sword drawn and ready.

 "May I help you?" it asked me.

 "Who are you?"

 "I am Livius."

 "Are you a ghost?"

 "No, I am a virtual traveler."

 "What's that?"

 "I have no physical self."

 A ghost.

 #

 Livius was quite the braggart. He claimed to be the first star traveler, first super being, and the master of the wormholes.

 According to Livius, all the known intelligent species originally developed in an isolation enforced by the vast distances between stars. However, most species eventually discovered the use of quantum communication and joined the Star Net, an informal society that traded information throughout the galaxy.

 Livius became the first star traveler by transmitting images of himself to other stars where he lived as virtual beings in alien computers. In time, as his copies propagated and exchanged experiences, he achieved a galactic presence.

 When the humans joined the Star Net, Livius recruited them into the wormhole project. He sent them on a sub-light-speed voyage to a nearby star system where they discovered the mechanicals, beings with the ability to interact with cosmic strings. With Livius' guidance, the mechanicals and their human mechanics learned to transform the cosmic strings into wormholes. Together, they created a star-faring society that expanded rapidly outwards from Earth.

 "That's great," I said. "But what about the Elevator?"

 "The Elevator is unstable."

 "No kidding."

 "I have initiated commands to restore stability. Are there mechanicals?"

 "Why?"

 "The Star Net has gone quiet. An investigation is necessary." 

 CHAPTER 17

 -- SCHOLARS

 

 The trouble with school is all the ceremonies. They have to have them, but you would think that they would let me give the speeches.

 The procession left the University and came through the town, heading towards the Court of One Law. Justice Captain Anne led the way. I was holding her arm. Robyn marched alongside Anne, carrying the purple pennant of justice and Saratan marched beside me, carrying the gypsy silver. We were followed by the other scholars, their captains, and their pennants.

 As we passed through the crowd, the town boys greeted the Captains with a chorus of whistles and commentary about their looks and muscles. The Captains were expected to maintain a dignified and somber posture through the hazing, but when I glanced at Anne she was grinning.

 As each couple entered the court, heralds blew their battle horns and the bailiff announced our names. Anne took me to stand before Proctor Lagrange and then departed. When all the students were assembled before the Proctor, he rose to speak.

 "Companies, this is a happy... Today we honor these young students whom... As scholars, your duty is to the One Law... "

 Why is he looking at me? My conscience was clear: I admired the One Law. Basing justice on the idea that wealth must be earned had worked well for the farmers. For boys, it was a better deal than what the bandits or the gypsies offered. And the humans, I knew, were tough enough to make it work for them.

 Snowshoe needed a stabilizing influence. According to Livius, natural reproduction was unraveling the genetic patches made by the fems. As the human population increased, their greater adaptability would fuel progress. People would be drawn to the cities, transforming Snowshoe from a rural to an urban society. The One Law would hold us together through the changes.

 Ellipse jabbed his elbow into my ribs. Everyone had his right hand in the air. "On my honor," we swore, "I pledge to uphold the One Law and... "

 #

 Later that evening as I walked along the fortress wall with Anne and the girls, we looked at the Elevator rising straight into the sky.

 "I'm glad we're done with it," Anne said.

 I smiled. I had not, after all, done so badly. To be sure, five wives was a scandal, but with a human company, a boy could go places.

 I drew the cards from my pocket. The Mechanical, the card that had started it all, was on top. And I still had the Traveler and Ancestor.

 Cards and humans -- if the Beast was right, if something was amiss in the galaxy -- I would have need of them.

 I looked up at the night sky and spread my arms.
