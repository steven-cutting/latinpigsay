 Rhyme and Reason- a compilation of verses , rhymes and

 senses

 by Dom

 IN MY PLACE

 Pray thee let none shall bar

 it's not the questions, where or when

 God grant I shan't be far

 In place of person, spirit then

 8>)

 RISKING FOR A SIGN

 The nectar is sweet

 if the heart so dares

 never for the meek

 where riskiness stares

 Just risking for a sign

 It won't stay when you stay

 Goes when you're own your toes

 The rewards are from the chase

 Reach for it but never in haste

 Nothing does like it does

 By Faith we hope and pray

 Events roll out and lay

 Grasp for handles in a maze

 Readiness with a brace

 I'll take it in if I may

 The nectar is sweet

 if the heart so dares

 those willing to seek

 where riskiness bares

 Just risking for a sign

 8>)

 RISE AND SHINE

 Gilded sun rays clear the haze

 Lighted lights go out apace

 Another rise over the mount

 Live creatures roused from their fount

 Beings they gather and disperse

 Shrieking shouts and small whispers

 Wings above while eyes trained below

 all stir for what might follow

 Those ordained all fall in line

 some lie still in thoughts opined

 chosen ones to fruition live

 while others Fates weigh and sieve

 8>)

 FOR MY FRIENDS

 1

 Courtesy in deeds driven

 Ev'ry gesture plays a part

 Fair regard gladly given

 Fondness well planted in heart

 2

 Ye fair rovers in life

 torches glow and fires swell

 upon the reach of warm hive

 We wish thee "all be well"

 3

 For those true let none deceive

 Be relieved by what's believed

 Within sadness joy's reprieve

 Joy increased from joy received

 8>)

 YEAR'S END

 The present year retires

 to rest with history

 Another course expires

 to lodge in memory

 A new course woven and spun

 while we adorn its space

 Concerns commence and are done

 come what may rush or haste

 A hope and toast to what's new

 fond farewell to what's past

 Let our joys never be few

 and may fond regard last

 8>)

 BLISS WE'RE FINDIN'

 The heart shan't huddle in heavy pinin'

 For as long as there's a silver linin'

 From murky shadows it's hope we're minin'

 Through search and tumble it's bliss we're findin'

 8>)

 A GLANCE AT TIME

 What is this fleeting moment?

 An hourglass filled with cascading sand

 Passes us in joy or lament

 While we compelled or by own choosing attend

 8>)

 CRUMB, ICEBERG AND GLIMMER

 A few things to nourish us

 in this request in verse

 Give us a crumb from that loaf

 A humble comfort blanket

 Grant us a splinter of frost above

 Findings spawn from tip of iceberg

 Save some glow off the glimmer

 Hope preserved and mirrored

 Those who give shan't be in want

 Those who receive in penury shan't

 If they wisely give

 and they wisely spend

 There'll be none to grieve

 But much to append

 8>)

 ANTIQUE STREET

 Faded bronze picture pretty

 where cracks add curiosity

 mounting age make things vintage

 authentic guarantee's pledge

 yesterday's streets I tarry

 Green moss carpets alley

 8>)

 A VERSE OF THANKS

 I thank thee for thy patronage

 rhyme like wine improves with age

 though I shan't be a hermit sage

 I'm glad thou had found this page

 8>)

 FOR VERSES' SAKE

 There's nothing here at stake

 But the reasons we state

 come play for verses' sake

 lines of prosaic prose break

 8>)

 HOPE IN THE DARKEST HOUR

 The pall of the darkest hour

 Is lifted by Faith's power

 Let burn your resolve's ardour

 There's relief in Hope's harbour!

 8>)

 NUMBER CRUNCHER

 one over two I am not

 two of three they said not

 three times four she had not

 four from five he knew not

 five and six a naught not

 six sevens they saw not

 seven eights it was not

 eight nines they brought not

 nine a ten it is not

 Good heavens is what I've got!

 8>)

 World from my windowpane

 The world is well and sane

 From my eyeview's windowpane

 While Good charged and shook its mane

 Thoughts drift on a saunterly train

 8>)

 It's not too late

 Lady Fortune nudges coyly

 Pandora strikes stealthily

 Hope stays in purposeful wait

 All that's Good, it's not too late

 8>)

 The Archer

 The Archer pulls his bowstring

 Yonder what lies in hiding

 One shot hits its target true

 Hinders doubts which worries spew

 8>)

 Life and Rhetoric I

 Though oft cautioned we pass unwarily

 An earthly life's junctures and maze

 Fitting pieces circumstantially

 In wakeful awareness and daze

 8>)

 Life and Rhetoric II

 Circumstance is fleeting

 We run with the current and do what we must

 In retrospect fitting

 Ignorant of present and wise of the past

 8>)

 Here's a Crowd

 Chaos plays Jack-in-a-Box

 Father Time oils his clocks

 Mother Nature preens her hair

 Courage makes his own chair

 Fate deals her card deck

 Past is ever dwelling back

 Present plays with Here and Now

 Future poses with When and How

 Peace reclines in sweet repose

 Purity, not a spot on her clothes

 Wish speculates wistfully

 Reality alters mercurially

 Sleep is strictly not to be disturbed

 Wakefulness stirs on its own turf

 Those which have been named

 Our tempers they have tamed

 Spans of ages they have reigned

 Outlasting Pride and things vain

 8>)

 Emerge

 From its perch molten orb uncovers day

 As diurnal beings emerge to seek hay

 From its perch Certainty clears murky

 As it hands Conscience the masterkey

 8>)

 Diggging the heels

 We are drunk by sweet claret

 Our Fates dealt by tarot

 By causes the brows had furrowed

 For causes reserves had burrowed

 Take us to where redemption's moored

 We head forth firm where none detoured

 8>)

 Glutton's Delight

 Surprise quirks spur a thirst

 that which quenches hungers

 a second follows first

 that which restores changes

 8>)

 Allow Me

 Allow me your sweet musings

 Those worry and hurry overlooked

 Fairer than sweet nothings

 Solace and Patience shan't be duped

 8>)

 Curiosity

 Curiosity taps my hesitation

 My gaze blinks warily

 What's the price of revelation?

 Mere lunge and peep only?

 8>)

 Same Suspect

 The hand that won the crown

 The same hand wipes the brow

 Look ye all up and down

 The same one anyhow

 8>)

 Lines of Joy

 Our bliss filled wings flutter

 The heart traipses with rapture

 Pure joy has its mirrors

 Smiling delight it sires

 8>)

 Be the Spark

 Let not might expire

 At the topmost spire

 Nor fine sinews tire

 Bogged in messy mire

 Come strike and feed first spark

 Hues to all pale and stark

 8>)

 Morrow

 Within a bewildered mire

 Resolve sires inner fire

 Speedy streaks aimless confusion wreaks

 Like brittle burnt twigs confusion creaks

 An inner spark, emerges, divulges

 Upon mortal frailty, comforts, touches

 Lament not in sorrow

 Embrace the fair morrow

 Deeds past lodge in memory's place

 My time now in haste or good pace

 The crook of the trick my conscience prick

 Truth I seek for it I shan't be meek

 A lively spark, emerges, divulges

 Upon mortal frailty , comforts, touches

 Lament not with sorrow

 Embrace the fair morrow

 8>)

 Scaling The Ladder

 Mighty obligation curtailed voice

 Left us splinters we took as choice

 I've been bumped from nook to cranny

 Had some, somedays crumbs of plenty

 Yet learned and notched miles and hours

 On wet grass to brazen towers

 It's sweat, dread, I'm glad to have left

 Despite and in spite of, unsapped

 On full alert to hit the heights

 Bide in stride and take in the sights

 8>)

 The seer said to me

 Fear me not I am not Harm

 Unclench fists and ready arm

 I see woven threads, wordly realms

 The beaten track and what it seems

 Crossroads present ripples the current

 Absent indulgence tickles serpent

 Bridge the chasmic ridge

 Defy Destiny you live in grief

 Welcome what's to be then judge and sieve

 Keep the torch blazing in its glow

 Leave solace basking in the know

 My sanctum now sows the seed

 The seer's form to edge recede

 8>)

 SURSUM CORDA-Lift up your hearts

 Come my dears the sun yellow

 Beckons thee out of sorrowful wallow

 The pit of tears runs too shallow

 For lively spirits mellow and callow

 Let's be gone with many a-bellow

 We cross the hollow elbow to elbow

 8>)

 FINICKY FANCY

 Go and Run ,skulk and hide

 The hazy signs of next delight

 ever mercurial as fickle tide

 you say it's done then you might

 I shall run and stay beside

 No cell here is watertight

 Evolution's a bumpy ride

 It's not done, might just might

 8>)

 RHYME JIVE

 Glasses of wine crowns a good dine

 Sips of rhyme to while the time

 I say mine, you say your line

 Brightens the clime, isn't it fine?

 8>)

 Taken from a drunk's pocket:

 If you said gin and tonic

 I think you're prophetic

 But if you called for beer

 Bear the wine drinkers' sneer

 Got caught in my veins some scotch

 Surprised my mind's not scorched

 If I hear of old Bloody Mary

 Let me check out cash and carry

 Now don't you say rum and tequila

 My marushka let's pour some vodka

 I'm really not that taciturn

 Just the burden of some bourbon

 8>)

 SEASIDE SUNRISE

 From distance and depths they roll

 nearer like a constant stroll

 their formation fluidly rustling

 nearing leaves slovenly shaking

 salt in my nose, curled up my toes

 I can see the troopers moving hither

 Horizon of scattered specks

 unheeding fluid troopers' tracks

 wavy phalanx forward advance

 prance a primordial nature's dance

 glare in my eyes, from morn sunrise

 my attention attends along the strand

 8>)

 Requiem

 Drowned by the hand of mortality

 a soul shines where Angels ply

 with Goodness pure and Divine mercy

 (s)he now dwells where Angels fly

 8>)

 Face in the Crowd

 When it all rolls over

 and our hearts sobered

 I'll be a face in the crowd

 When the hurly-burly bustle

 on its own weight tumble

 I'll stay a face in the crowd

 When I take things slower

 and I'm less of a mover

 I'll be a face in the crowd

 When I'm less able

 to bet on the table

 I'll stay a face in the crowd

 When voices speak softer

 less to excite over

 I'll be a face in the crowd

 Let's pack it all in

 live off it from within

 Just like a face in the crowd

 8>)

 All in All

 All our given sunrises

 All our sunsets ordained

 All our best desires

 All our hearts proclaimed

 All untruth never maul

 All truest all in all

 8>)

 AIR OF SUSPENSE

 An air of suspense sweeps over me

 A wonder only seen in dreams

 A great rush of heavenly fidelity

 and my spirit dances among moonbeams

 High over valleys

 my joy rallies

 I wish and long to dally

 alas dreams are like snow

 fade when it's time to go

 But this joy I'll evermore recall

 when among the clouds I stand tall

 as my heart leaps, among hilly peaks

 I'll cherish deep and recall the trip

 An air of suspense sweeps over me

 A wonder only seen in dreams

 A great rush of heavenly fidelity

 and my spirit dances among moonbeams

 8>)

 Consolation for a Nightingale

 For though it seems the horizon wide

 was swallowed by the ink of night

 Hope still resides by your side

 Strength to resume sparks alight

 8>)

 Happiness when it Comes

 Happiness isn't an all time high

 But when it comes it does not lie

 as much as you can without frowning

 and letting go without drowning

 Not the mystery tucked in a box

 or a steeple chase marked by clocks

 Contentment and an unruffled heart

 A gift from Life, an acquired art!

 8>)

 Poet at Play

 sparks and thoughts they do combine

 thy brief verses grant it clime

 the poetic deed shall be incomplete

 should verse denied of rhyme replete

 at rest in this forest I do beseech

 a pause then to Parnassus reach !

 symmetry of rhyme addiction

 weaves and spins bear fruition

 past concepts and articulations

 through the truth and truisms

 thus the quest of poetic frenzy

 by far loftier than mere fancy

 8>)

 DOM THE GOOF

 Footsteps, they clatter

 as I looked to the mirror

 is it for the better?

 I'm a habitual worrier

 Your eyes reached for me

 but I was ever unsure

 did I transgress decency

 of this new culture?

 It was not what it seemed

 this gaze of avid urgency

 A glass up to its brim

 I carried on nonchalantly

 The waiter a while lingered

 thought he a catastrophe

 a full glass to him mattered

 another spill casualty?

 I delicately sipped

 the outskirts of the rim

 thus in one sip I nipped

 the bungle at the brim

 8>)

 A WORD ON WORDS-revised 2002

 Words to proselitize

 Words to hail

 Words to define

 Words to douse silence

 Words to rouse

 Speech is a double edged gift

 In stroke , ails and heals.

 Words to state plainly

 Words to choke gasps of worries

 Words to accompany deeds

 Words to line void of ignorance

 Words to fill gaps of craving

 Language is a double edged gift

 In a swoop , blights and blesses.

 8>)

 A SMILING CONUNDRUM

 A simple act of smiling carries abundant nuances. Its appearance unfolds subtleties in spells so brief that attention has to acquire suppleness and clairvoyance in order to trace its intention. An emotional armour, an ignorant smirk, a habitual display, a crack of dismay. It serves as an olive branch, a link of mutuality, a spirit booster, a disarming tool. It wriggles so mildly into the domain that it catches us off-guard in an awkward pose in the midst of some complication, a teaser's toy, a perplexing foil, a facial perk up. It has beguiled hearts for generations, a warm gesture of agreement , nonchalant bravado, unperturbed defiance, a universal affirmation of pleasure. 8>)

 BETWEEN FASTING AND FEASTING

 Inspiration alternates between fasting and feasting. Let it cascade from funnels of thoughts. Improvise and let fancies weave as much and as often as they please. There is unity despite this mish-mesh . Inspiration gushes more than our fill can contain. It flows till each kernel is milked of its essence, then recedes to miserly trickling.

 It hibernates as themes ossify, mummified in rumination's chrysalis. Charges to the fore of consciousness and floats to the spout of the fount when ripeness blooms. 8>)

 ON PARTING

 I had long anticipated this parting. I had wept in anticipation of this. Intense pain coiled around refusal and vexation, caused by anger that it should pass so soon. To heave our chests with sobs, wail ourselves hoarse, sap breath of air are futile. Part we must.

 I cannot offer tears now. I had wept in anticipation of this. Senses stay with me as I go about matter-of-factly. But sorrow is real. Whoever who has emotions and compassion will surely feel the tight knot on heartstrings in times of grief. Part we must.

 Mourning lasts not forever. Speak not of regret. Seek joys shared. Extricate the most comely or comical picture of the departed from recesses of recall or from the picture archive.

 Caress those treasured tokens. Care for them well. Mortality had usurped and carried them across the walls while those living, are moored here still. 8>)

 AFTER THE HURT

 We wince, grimace, we deny, we blush, we withdraw, we stumble, grapple for a hold then surge wildly with our hurt, to our sanctuary, for security, for support, for sympathy which we so badly lack. Our egos soothed, our pride mended, our resolve restored, our courage renewed. We make our way out of the zone of our sanctuary to the swirl of life, kingdom of actuality, the playfield of fortune, the polarity of cause and effect. We stand our ground, stake our claim, carve our indentations upon eternity. 8>)

 AT THE DOCKS

 Pungence of the coast enter the nostrils before sight glimpses the first outlines of the docks. As we gaze around the coastal settlement , all manner of architecture, decorations, signage and paraphernalia suggest an ode to the sea and a boatman's lot.

 The utilitarian magnetism of a rugged painted scene experienced live. Water's surface beside ravaged outskirts of the docks. Rusty submerged pillars and barnacles, so common a sight, they go unnoticed.

 Foam formations and breaking foam. Reflections of the surface on a good sunny day like fluid sequins , they gleam. Vessels off to the wide open and vessels approaching. The mutable tide and current. Bobbing buoys and crafts.

 An assemblage of scattered generators, expelled fumes, sputtering engines with cadence of speech merge to form a union of din. Picture perfect for a tourist. It's an average day in the lives of those whose fortunes depend on the day's catch and nature's dictates.

 Tobacco smoke, grunts, gruff ramblings, murmurs, occasional raised volume, wellingtons, raincoats, overcoats and windbreakers. Footsteps upon tarred passages. Shadows of beings cast on cobblestone walkways. The stooped, hunched, sprightly and nimble.

 It's a rare sight for a pristine boat to be moored at the docks or a seafarer in uncreased gear, whose presence is devoid of telltale salty scent. Eyes accustomed to the regular scene spies a newcomer with ease. 8>)

 WANDERER'S NOTATION

 A trace of superstition still hangs upon them. The past is as tangible as actuality. They live it, they breathe within dominions of their time and those once trod by their forefathers. The legacy is both strong and benevolent. Hence , so is the affinity between generations long parted and the living present.

 The departed have never truly departed from the consciousness of those still living, though not every name is known but their presence is persistent. The people here, they're a mite superstitious. Youthful formative years were liberally imbued with rhymes and odes of folklore where there is no sharp divide of legend from history. The structured education of logic, truth and reasoning heap upon indentations first forged by lore, diligently learned during childhood.

 A clear innocence flavour their pursuits. A sense of unobtrusive dignity pervade pursuits spanning from exalted undertakings to prosaic chores. If there is a place where a wanderer would gaze back with longing in heart and a vow to return, it would be this.

 NO. 11

 (A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING)

 a trail of cold wetness

 a passing rain's legacy

 a weekend's night

 at the square's hub

 pungence of pumping exhaust

 hazy light beams streak

 their path through the murky blur

 the public mingle at street fringes

 as streaks of lights

 mark their motorised presence

 has anyone found their night's beacon ?

 or is it only tonight's attraction

 destined to be next morning's faded memory ?

 screeches and skids

 upon asphalt surface

 burning rubber doused by moist surface

 thrills in a rush

 bets on the line for momentary glory

 without flawless display

 a reckless fool he becomes

 how we've lived and where we're heading vanishes

 when adrenaline shoots from a quick draw

 all philosophical speculation abruptly cease

 has anyone found their life's beacon ?

 or is it only tonight's attraction

 destined to crack up and fade at first light ?

 8>)

 MARKET PLACE

 Peddlers and buyers parley. Each trying to inch to a compromise. When the deal is struck it is a mutual reward of patience for both. Both profit at an agreed cost. Hear peddlers hail and rave indiscreetly about their wares to passers-by with the purpose of making buyers out of browsers.

 The market place is where material desire pursues realistic needs and perpetuates the jousting between persuasive wit and adamant refusal. Sweet recommendations slide up to those who pass by without a list and fill their minds with the lure of the next bargain.

 Barrage upon barrage of humanity locked in bargaining, scurrying to and from , browsing without purpose, seeking with marked intentions. The market place is where friends with acquaintances , kinfolk with strangers tread the common way. Fresh links hooked. Old ties renewed. It is up to the individual to disclose or evade the throng of queries.

 Smoothen frowns caused by fretting . Weary minds, take a hike along the market place. There's variety to be had within the stream of humanity there. It teases interest and flicks a spark on the fuse of humour. With senses and caution, join the jostling. Emerge none the poorer. So much the richer.

 8>)

 CORNER STREET

 A mob masses at a side street. Something which they hear intrigue them so. It rises above their routine bustling hassle.

 A booming invitation from a corner street salesman who hones his pitch to perfection. He nets commuters with his velvet lure of promise... for a fee. Wielding his selling lines like a coveted bauble while he tugs with his words. Those touched by his pitch tow along like an entourage of mice, latching on to the Pied Piper. The horde crane their necks for a ring side view , stretch limbs to advance nearer and strain sight for a close up. He stands high , above all heads , on a concrete pulpit and proceeds to wean all to his prescription. He proclaims "For a fee, the majority will attain a share of a rare minority".

 8>)

 PROMENADE MUSICIAN

 A promenade musician with repertoire of tunes to whisk the rhythm of your gait away. Fixes you to a standstill and makes the heart yearn for sweetness which she coaxes from the strings. She plays for her keep. Touched generosity bestow appreciation into a ready hat.

 The last note done , she raises her head to acknowledge the spontaneous cheers. Gazes back to the tool of her trade, readies herself and plucks the strings again to sweep the next passer-by into the honeyed core of melody.

 8>)

 OF DESIRE AND VIGOUR

 We are charioteers with vigorous steeds, eager to spring off to pace the breeze and pit against the wind. But what is vigour without defined intent ? A fatuous waste of good strength. Fuse desire, vigour and achievement into a singular fruition. When splintered, there is inner vortex which spirals and heckles mercilessly, relentlessly. Restless ambition is unsettled. It leaps in step with rousing craving. Wanting, coveting, desiring, they are emotions coaxed into being by experience, which meddle with our senses. Tame their potency, induce direction and order. To do so , the heart's pounding is reined and driven by reason. 8>)

 ARCADIA

 A place to grow old in.

 Verdant slopes teem with pastoral greenery. Waves splinter on craggy rocks and cliffs. They, the vanguards of the coast. Showered and mired with the sea's deep blue depth. Effervescent streaks of foam marks each agitation. Thoroughfares , serenaded by minstrels. Be enchanted by wayfarer's tales, drawn to the romance of fables and ruminate on the bitter-sweet myths. Trace stony mounds with the soles as the feet step on cobble stone streets. Homely public houses, freshly cooked square meals at caf&#8218;s and bonhomie, as common as courtesy. Live our days in contentment. Good banter abound and rousing humour gallops. It is at once both country and city. Neither be in want of conveniences nor be compelled to forego the space of privacy.

 A place to grow old in.

 8>)

 PAGAN PRAYER

 Divine Apollo, won't you roll us another day ? Slide the shadows and give us light. Then we'll know that yesterday was not our last. We live another day to tread and carve this earth.

 Orpheus, won't you play us another tune ? Spur those weary ones. Lull anguished souls. Calm eddies of worried minds. Soothe and entertain those left.

 Poseidon, bring your chariot over your kingdom of the sea, with your sacred trident, bless the seas with plenty. Let the winds be kind to sailors. Let the catch be rich. Tame the ocean's ferocity when it vexes.

 Aphrodite, be benevolent to those who seek love. Kindle passion yet temper its infectious intensity lest the glow becomes a torrid pyre. Eros plays tricks with his arrows and bow. Allow us the power to discern with liberty of choice and reason as company.

 Hermes, we pray that you bring glad tidings to us mortals. We long to hear you proclaim , o messenger of the Gods , that needless bloodshed shall be no more. That goodness rules. Hope subdues chaos released by Pandora. All injustice undone. Suffering's grief and tears shed cleansed from memory.

 Athene, guide us from machinations of Evil. Grant us the gift of Courage and Perseverance. The same which you had given Odysseus for we too endure our own odysseys. Demons and villains, they alter their guises well and cunningly.

 Hades, keep your train beneath the world. Your faithful Cerberus, bark and bite not at mortal heels before our time. Our course governed by Heaven's trade with the Reapers at your command. O Fates, lead us gently and guide us well into the Hereafter.

 Supreme Zeus, the one of the feared thunderbolt. Mightiest of Olympians, final arbiter. With a fraction of your wisdom, we shall have sight of sense. With that sense, breathe wisdom in our actions and curtail weaknesses. Your blessing and mercy be upon us all still. 8>)

 Drunk on Rhyme

 1

 What's to come, to be done

 This while's all future and now

 Impulse leaves with gracious bow

 Straying would've harmed

 2

 The ebbing glow of twilight

 Brings the hints of hopes bright

 Dispense of loud proclamations

 There's ample from quiet assurances

 Heartening presence in spirit

 Which no one else but us know it

 3

 We enjoy the delights within our grasp

 Tempted by mirages out of reach

 Forsake comforts for sweat and gasps

 to return with trophies and preach

 4

 What's said in confidence

 Expects silence in return

 To stay true to intention

 Is the best recompense

 8>)

 Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+ If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.

 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

 At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks. We need funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain or increase our production and reach our goals.

 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

 As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

 We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones that have responded.

 As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states. Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

 In answer to various questions we have received on this:

 We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally request donations in all 50 states. If your state is not listed and you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have, just ask.

 While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to donate.

 International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are ways.
