 Poets have wrongd poor storms: such days are best;

 They purge the air without, within the breast.

 George Herbert

 Cultural Misappropriation

 is that what I hear you cry, citizen?

 If a delph-glazed moon with its O so

 delicate pattern pans over Holland, flat as

 a tack, it also comes by way of the

 Antarctic circle right to your doorstep

 in equal measure. If the sun clamps

 its golden torque on mosque or synagogue, pa,

 cathedral or sacred site, does this endorse

 any one people over another? Is it your wish

 to head off the cultural bandits at the

 historical impasse, citizen, by placing a

 patent on your mana? Beware the polemicists

 who define and so divide, who aggregate

 authority unto self where before lay none.

 Symbol becomes the circumference of

 time & custom. It is not the thing itself,

 but the beautiful echo of a peoples harmonic

 which cannot be bounded nor weakened.

 Here lies the camouflage that protects the

 ancient matrix, the silent memory of our

 bloods journey & sound leads you to it.

 Word Maps

 

 Down By The River

 

 Of the brain, mushroom shaped as

 bomb blast, we project the image to

 fact; up river from the torrent,

 amongst the calmness of boulders, the

 angler shadow-casts looping

 the steady surface for the archetypal

 fish whose leapt arch anticipates t

 but the headwaters are held greyly

 back by a concrete-net on this

 dappled and uncaptured urban afternoon.

 He deftly flicks & spools back and

 forth from channel to channel.

 2. National Park Holiday

 If you go into the woods

 today you will be part of a task

 force moving in line-formation.

 You will allow that the plastic yellow

 tape which cordons off select

 areas does not imply a Sacred Grove.

 If you go into the woods

 today, disinterment, not picnics,

 is the order of inquiry. The

 Vegetable Kingdom remains thoroughly

 documented and every species is

 accounted for; some of whom are

 human, or parts thereof.

 3. False Idols

 It was always wood, wood

 along the way, and exits went from

 grove to sacred grove till deeper wood

 lay beyond the Roman shield and sword;

 that, though, belongs to another

 picture book. The lyre-bird mimics the

 chainsaw and Birds of Paradise

 spit chips. Along the Hume Hwy. east

 of Eden, a concrete Mountain Ash

 dubbed Yggdrasil boasts a

 wide-screen computer enhanced vista:

 an arrow-straight monorail running

 from Uluru clean through the Olgas.

 4. Surveyors Party

 These twin obelisks which guard

 the southern entrance to the Great Sandy

 desert, though partnered to a sun

 fiercer than anything Egypt had to

 offer, preside over a millennia of flat

 emptiness, and attest to the prowess,

 not of indigent cultures, but the

 engineering whim of the LAND BARONS

 who pray that one day, these too, will

 invoke an air-conditioned resort for

 the rich to dwell in, amongst hydromythological

 fountains, playing

 endlessly over sacred-site motifs.

 5. Got Ourselves A Convoy!

 Hi Ho! Hi Ho! But theyve been

 laid off. Round Oberon, the town

 spirit flat as a plank; then fury knots

 in pubs. The big rigs aim chrome

 cowlings at Canberra, Convoy! through

 the ring roads to circle Parliament House

 wagon-style. Hey, you cant knock

 it: logging by generations for

 generations have trod them down. Count

 the rings of the rigs revving. Each

 logger raw-red, necks blood-throttled.

 Say what, anger? You can put a ring

 around that, champ. Hi Ho! Hi Ho!

 6. Cultural Desert

 The earth is dismembered & what

 remains gives evidence; clues: history

 by blocks displaced as in the Aswan

 Dam & the Temple of Philae. Osiris rolls

 in the winding sheet of the Nile

 (O moisture of the World!) and vainly

 cry the well-wishers. Richard Burton

 tracked the source back to Lake

 Victoria, and back again to the Royal

 Geographical Society; no gushing

 waters from the cleft rock, only lameness,

 fever under the rays of the Sun God, Ra.

 7. Down By The Station

 Indecision. Doubt. A bungled

 liftoff, the bumpy landing. Of course,

 the forest dwellers who continuously

 run at you from tangled undergrowth

 onto the stubbled airstrip, dreamlike,

 dont make it: LAST CANNIBAL WORLD:

 lithe tribal girl hand jobs hero through

 bamboo cage. The spiked wooden ball

 swishes from tree canopy to impale

 support cast. Sunday matinee in country

 town. Farm boys lope under dirty clouds

 to crop-dusted paddocks, and water

 slips by the BP Service Station, somewhere.

 8. Continental Shelf Co.

 I officially declare the millennial

 Poets Symposium on the Age of Inner

 Space now open: Welcome to OCEANISM.

 Poets are required to be proficient

 in submarine mythology of an exploratory

 and Cousteauesque manner, able to

 identify myriad life-forms luminescent yet

 undiscovered (except, perhaps, for the

 Vampire Squid) at depths unsounded, in

 sea trenches unknown, free, hopefully of

 maritime wrecks & missiles from any epoch;

 whose task it is to float lines at once

 filigreed as plankton, filtered as sunlight.

 9. Three Cheers The Militia!

 What plays us back - death? That

 this worlds a stage and we upon it act

 to revolve the scenery with our yearning:

 and while the syrinx play, panic rebounds

 to the dead cry: ET IN ARCADIA EGO

 from the walled garden and far wilderness.

 O desert! O armour-plated sun!

 Under a scornful wind the madmen bellow

 and tribes cower amongst the rubble,

 caught in the sound bites & grabs of war:

 Tibet, Chechnya, Kurdistan, Iraq, Burundi,

 plus the boys in the hills back of Montana.

 10. Video Conference

 Like a hurried geology that

 arose out off glasshouses came the

 skyscrapers; meanwhile, History

 cut a swathe through the Natural World

 and architecture strove to regain it.

 Lost to the familiar, Age moved us

 out of living memory, unlike those tribes,

 the autochthons who saw the earths

 infancy still. Let us go, you & I,

 to re-invent the damage and call it

 discovery, to uniformly lift up our cry

 in schadenfreude, meek before Great Cities

 that bend as fenders to the glare.

 11. Crow Country

 A field of wheat, a paddock of

 stubble, the chafed dust-cloud staggers

 the pick-up at distance, the Rock

 of Ages rises over Plainville: pop:

 dead serious. No hermits, only

 the bowing pumps facing west for oil.

 Family photos hang easy next to

 the semiautomatic in each clapboard.

 The Long Horn Saloon boasts the

 one rule: NO SPITTING. NO STRANGERS.

 The hard hats passed round every

 Sunday and the big fists knuckle under

 prayer & flag real righteous like.

 12. Hills Of Home

 Greywacke mostly, & fat pale

 clay where I troubled the hills about

 Wellington (Brooklyn-west) that

 you dug through to reach China as a

 kid out-the-back of our place.

 The gorse gully and yellow flowers,

 black seed-pods bursting in the summer

 heat. Down you went past broken

 bottled glass to the untouched cool

 clay hoping any moment to pot hole up

 into a paddy field through the

 earths centre. Every failed dig

 stayed a secret from adults, forever.

 13. Eco-Tourism

 Welcome to Smeltback Inc.

 copper, zinc, lead, uranium, iron,

 O mineral gardens of the Inland Sea!

 A company satellite tremulous as

 a divining-rod maps onto flow charts

 corporate terrain; prospectus

 for all the kingdoms of the earth.

 Radio Redneck pumps the poet

 who banks safe on a right-wing bet,

 steadies to subvert the norm

 for God and Clever Countrys sake.

 Prettily thus he underbends the knee

 to throw his best foot forward O.

 Generation of 68

 Frank OHara (here Im skating slow

 on sacred ice) has got a lot to answer

 for, yet who hasnt? Take the legacy

 of 60s poets, for example, who cant

 help but write like him; syntactically

 careering around his blizzard of words,

 elbow-jolting crazily, clutching at

 each others earmuffs, buttonholing

 opportunity. Seems they did that as

 par for the course till it got too dizzy.

 Round and round the freedom rink they

 went & those who zigzagged quick & cut

 up rough fell back upon the railings

 youth exhausted to exhale worn, cautious

 success though tried not to show it.

 What happened to the stragglers in the

 maul is anyones guess; some unmarried,

 a good number courted hardship whatever.

 Nobody cares overly much. The 60s poets

 they go on to write like Frank OHara:

 fewer drop-by parties, meaner somehow.

 Pat Boone & Tonto

 White-shirted (not blue)

 they approach in twos:

 Excuse me Sir, a small

 moment of your time?

 Soft-selling eternity &

 the clean-cut hereafter.

 The boyish accent downloads

 the serious side of the

 American dream, eyes fixed

 computer bright. The other

 is slower, slope-shouldered

 & discipled, backgrounded

 by a blandished brain.

 As a child, when the God

 was always friendly,

 big as a house, long as a

 street & the day endless,

 the knock upon the door

 signalled: Excuse me

 young man, is the lady of

 the house in? Welcome

 the suitcased salesman; the

 Bon-Brush Man: big-bristled,

 wooden-backed scrubbing

 & bottle brushes, sandsoap

 & Brasso for hard domestic

 usage. Not now. These two

 modern peddlers head out

 to the brick bungalows of

 the inner city suburbs

 selling the Light & the Way,

 galloping round the outer

 handicapped districts;

 brainwashed right-wing angels

 confident as professional

 sportsmen on a World Tour.

 To Talk of Flags

 The flags fall like large, hollow,

 monochrome leaves, said Ritsos, but

 this isnt Greece. How can you talk of

 changing flags as blithely as you

 would a marriage? When we fly the flag

 its as label to proclaim attitude,

 and rightly so, too: the Remembrance

 Day Parades, Expansionism, other

 peoples wars; the main street of every

 country town at the dying of day lights

 up the Unknown Soldier & the long

 lists of the Dead written in lead. No,

 these things will always hold, rung up

 once yearly, regular as a poker-machine.

 Change flags, to acknowledge what? Whose

 domestic honour, what custodial deaths?

 Words to Lure a Ghost

 An exiles soliloquy

 Henley Pub? I am one year from

 your death, and a mad mile from your

 achievement twenty or so years

 down the track. I think you may have

 killed a few of us off, brother,

 who rejoiced

 in your thicket of sorrows. Jim Baxter,

 if a cabbage tree marks your spot by

 the river,

 I am glad of it.

 After you went, we were too eager

 for another Apollo, and the laurel

 was tossed from

 hand to poetic hand like a hot kumara.

 Most dropped it. A number were swept

 by the winter river with the eels

 into the Underworld.The God Love

 and the God Vengeance sat down

 in a burnt out warehouse to share out the

 small morsels

 of pain.

 The poets are playing hide-and-seek

 with each other in and out of marriage.

 The sharing is done.

 A southerly

 whistles up over the gun emplacements on

 Brooklyn Hill,Jim, scattering

 the unposted Autumn leaves.

 Christmas

 Under the mining operations of

 the moon, continental drifts of cloud

 collude and a pelican scaffolds

 the air. In cities, bricks sweat. We

 are blinded by the rush to live;

 keep it moving, says the sense of loss,

 our common language. The information

 Super Highway informs to inform

 supra clicks the instinct. Hold on

 screens survival. We are built upon

 reflection; under the arch of the railway

 see the conduit flow & steady in the

 round. A piece of hill lights up and

 beneath it shadow so shakes the net.

 Hear the sheer drag of scythe on metal

 the shunter makes at the curve of the

 viaduct while, with elongated wail, rolls

 three spoil-wagons to the hollow hill.

 Emblems

 

 Adam

 

 A lamp passed behind a perforated shield;

 stars leaked. What he thought thunder brought

 footfalls of lightning. He scanned over the

 plateau & nowhere found a neighbours spoor.

 2. Oblation

 The Island nations of the colder latitudes

 breed alluvial poets, it is believed, who convene

 once yearly under friendly, arched viaducts

 to talk of river shingle, boulder, and water birds.

 3. Detail

 The yellow machinery tracks on the freeway

 are as soldiers in single file stretching out into the

 late afternoon, slanting sun, shadow-crimson

 earth leaning forward to the compassed horizon.

 4. Born

 The year of my birth followed by a hyphen,

 by the solace of expectation, by a small measure

 of success, by a teasing out of hopelessness

 and of course, by another date yet to be fixed.

 5. Style

 Would he have leaped from the stern of the

 Orizaba, at noon on April 27, 1932 if hed known

 of the unfashionable rise in sea-levels 70 years

 hence; Hart Crane, a rhetorical gesture, surely?

 6. Beachcomber

 Pampiniform it writhes, bladder-wrack or

 kelp, a heavy swell that slops about rustily in

 the basalt trough, breaking through the sea rush;

 & solitary goes Heaney, curling at dictions.

 Transgenic Pigs

 The oink is a fugue, Baconian

 and philosophical. By a corncob moon

 they snaffle, silvery-hulled backs

 adrift & dolphin-arched in the mire. A

 litter of stars in the laboratory-bright

 sky. PUT SOME PORK ON YOUR FORK

 intones the television commercial. O but

 but these are no bristle & foam flecked

 boars of Arcadian Days, brutally twisting

 on some Danaan spearhaft, in a

 flying rage tearing at ilex roots, or

 blasting marble shards with iron-tough tusks.

 These are the sleek-lined, chrome-bright

 & delicate trottered. These with a call

 soothing as a computer bleat, ears

 alert as mobile phones, flesh pliable as

 an artichoke, temperament cool as a cold

 cut. These, the upwardly mobile,

 porcine delicacies, models of dinner-table

 decorum. Designer-label pigs, feted,

 wined & dined exemplars of taste, accepted

 in the most refined of social circles.

 These are the well-appointed pigs replete,

 with a privately funded education bred O

 so exclusively for the Export Drive.

 Sheet Music

 Like some murky storm that presages

 pain, or engine that mauls the curb, the

 stereo wallows its bass notes at the

 top of the head, lands soft as afterbirth.

 If you place a white sheet over America

 500 Indian Nations show like bloodspots,

 said Jim Harrison at Lake Superior,

 the buffalo and the Big Trees gone

 too. Greed! Mostly, beauty is nostalgia.

 The random motes of a rainbow end up

 on the garbage heap again. These sticks

 which encase the Great Lakes, Jim,

 are the Happy Hunting ground for the likes

 of you & me. Men picking on the chance

 sounds of emptiness. The daily round

 of campfire, man and nature, etc. A moon

 patient as an escalator, maybe. Its all

 been done before, anyhow. What was

 that about Indians leaving a flaw in the

 fabric for the soul to escape? Ours

 is the gift of factory seconds, well-made &

 well-meant through to a public we detest

 if you think about it. And the quickest way

 to solitude is via a four wheel drive, eh?

 Theres comfort in that mate, getting out.

 Myth & Mariolatry

 At a small village not

 far from Manila, in the house

 of armaments & munitions,

 in a house of grenades &

 ammunition, the plaster

 statue of the Virgin Mary as

 humble as a trademark,

 stands splashed in carmine

 tears like some peasant

 shot on a quiet morning bearing

 water from the creek.

 The hovels strewn about

 the hills are so many broken

 boxes. The sun is spinning

 clockwise for hope. One

 cloud out of nowhere & then a

 drape of blue that might

 be the sky. The gathering of

 people is more impressive

 than a food drop. They come

 at the appointed hour when

 the boy who serves as

 runner to the Beautiful Lady

 arrives, breathless, with

 the Word. Occasionally,

 the statue weeps paint-fresh

 tears. They will leave

 once faith is gathered in

 abundance like so many wild

 flowers off the nearest mountain

 slope. Here under a glass

 blown moon, a cool wind shall

 leave this place sacred.

 Stork

 The scene is of a deep rural setting done by one unhurried

 Impressionist, say, pre-World War 1, c.1907. Everything

 luxuriant, soft and round, the paint is combed out by cordial summer breezes. Countryside: Poland, a rained-on morning,

 the distant plash of milk into wooden pails sounds thinner

 than its clotted creaminess. The cobbled yard is blue and wet after the mornings sluicing; alder, elm or poplar windbreaks, but what shows through is the church spire you would observe if you lifted your gaze up from the unhitched wagon, its spars tilted off skyward from the fields, past chimney, gable, and farmstead. The stork is here on its top (though) bottom heavy nest of thickly woven twigs which throws the scene into surreal proportion, suggesting a still hour of witches and moonlight moving stealthily through the forests black patches. Stork, calm as a weathervane (a model) presides over maize and barley crops, that brighten through weeks of high summer, stretch tight as a canvas to the nearby farms, and further still, to centuries old, grassy marshlands from which the stork feeds its nestlings.

 Unmanned

 Take this day, lonely as a man in

 an empty house, at his window, the wintry yard

 below.

 Sea calm. The moon scatters its

 coinage. A rubber dinghy bucks an orectic

 surf. Pebble beach. The conning-tower signals:

 which came first, meaning or memory?

 One flashlight winks hungrily under seacliffs,

 and then the flare. This setting becomes

 an habitual space, chosen era for commando or

 smuggler.

 We make our choice, learn that grief comes

 regular as sunset.

 The bow-wave

 turned in chrome coils as the coastline dropped

 from view.

 Once in a metal-etched hour, people

 ran away to America to buildings the colour of

 gun-metal, to a sidewalk venting steam

 about the ankles of sable-stockinged girls.

 How many of us cannot begin the adventure of the

 day upon its arrival? The ablutions of the night done

 with, the half-bad dreams wiped away, the tensions

 of the muscles adjusted in preparation for the

 perpendicular, the carpet rolled back, the masks

 hung up once more upon the wall at the ready. Each

 waking is a starting out from the old country.

 The responsibility

 of light beckons, unclothes the familiar objects and not

 so familiar ones.

 Lightning leaves the expression surprised

 and the lone tree in the paddock startled with

 cinematic glare, unharmed and lovely.

 In a homely way,

 the headlights sweep the back yard hovering over the

 roped-swing in the pelting rain and neighbourhood

 of cat & dog. This tells you that the family

 is in deep trouble to be called into account in

 afteryears while the shutters slap wettish to little

 effect.

 Shaped as an emu neck, steam extends

 over the factory stack from the industrial sector

 in this small, southern city. A yellow band

 of horizon suggests sunset. The steam dissolves out.

 Now runs at 4:15 the see-through veins of rain from

 window to sill. A splashed up forest of drops tap out what

 is left of this late, ruined day in July.

 Here there is no history, if by history you mean

 the soul fired in the kiln of time. Here there is only

 the compilation of event in a scrap-yard of days

 & kicked aside incident.

 You can still hear the

 settlers squeeze box & fiddle in suburban settlements &

 tavern, the landscape-flat accents, the Sky Channel

 applause and throat-clearing of smoke exhaust.

 We remember the po-faced poets who went away never to

 return from the Ambition Wars & Success Sorties.

 As always, cars chittering in long queues in the

 persimmon light of dusk, on freeways dreary with drizzle

 and distance, at the encoded city-bound intersections.

 He makes his heroine his addiction and vice versa,

 becomes the object of obsession into which safe-zone he

 precipitates himself, unmanned.

 Away now from that well worn cliche,

 the crazy party hat of Sydneys Opera House / the bat-eared

 shells

 & clouds that muscle reflective buildings

 to the O so cloacal coil of green hills round the

 rectangular cattle, prominent as so many out-of-town acts

 in provincial centres.

 You pass smoothly in your car the valley below & there -

 an intimate scene: a family gathered shock still: the

 overhanging forest imaged on the coffin-lid,

 momentarily,

 then lowered into shadow. The town lies behind you.

 The world will change to that which forgets you

 and your enthusiasms will be as a passing fashion. In this

 you come to understand the nature of illusion

 and the hoped for

 expectations of youth, a too well-travelled dream. Here

 where life recedes further into distance

 you will know yourself as unmanned.

 Braidwood

 for Judith Wright

 Granite & quartz country, once

 gold rush, now cattle tread amongst

 the white hawthorn and yellow broom;

 from Captains Flat to Majors Creek

 the creek-beds cut the empty vein.

 Hail or heat, the hanged ghost

 of Thomas Braidwood rolls out his

 oaths big as boulders upon the town:

 dust, poverty, despair, drunkenness

 before he choked his rage at the

 end of a rope, phlegm thick as gossip.

 November 4, 1996

 Modern Love

 1.

 They are survivors, the sole

 occupants of this one guarded world.

 The local repertory theatre packed

 up & departed elsewhere. These two

 old troupers stay on as the sweeper

 plays his broom against the grain

 backstage. They play out by agreement

 the familiar angers to a suspension

 of hostilities. A semi-believed in love

 tried but haunted by its past. A

 self-deceiving hope posturing the loss

 of lives that went before of youth,

 of partners had & names forgotten.

 What holds at the seasons close

 is passion flogged to life like a

 single-piston engine, a sputtering

 exchange of plenitude, the usual run

 of days & dishes. The couple come home

 to roost at last, tense & too aware.

 2.

 Squinting back down the telescoped

 years as he had once through bombsights

 to that recently freed city, after the

 war & burnt out trams to how they

 first met. He posted to Berlin and the

 American sector, she from Baden Baden where

 he had fallen for her. So agile & aerial,

 a mermaid of the trapeze, star act of

 an old fashioned circus. A picture framed in

 time within the bleak cabaret of youth:

 he uniform crisp & she in sequined tights

 with her angels Wings of Desire

 flared from bared shoulder-blades. They are

 holding hands in celebration of the letter

 M. Now, married into age & ageless

 on an ancient Island, theirs is a love

 old as childhood & wise as water. Solidly

 based as the fist-backed rock of Uluru.

 Brilliant Losers

 On reading Geoff Cochranes Tin Nimbus

 The gay psychologist quoting The Divine

 Right of Kings and the lexicographer, his lifes

 dream of the Great New Zealand Dictionary,

 both entrenched alcoholics, both the originals

 Dostoyevsky might have claimed, although

 both stark losers by the worlds brute standards.

 Yes, I was there too, that late Saturday night

 after THE DUKE, riding the Kelburn cable-car up

 under the shadowy, Gothic pile of Victoria

 University, where furtive as hedgehogs, we found

 a hand-hold to jemmy open an illegal window,

 fossick the disused office for carton stacked upon

 carton, each one packed with indexed filing

 cards, meticulous references, NZ arcana, forgotten

 dialects, fables rare as moose from Southland,

 obscure derivations, etc., incalculable musings

 of an idealist and dreamer (this he showed us) here

 lay the singular industry of a reverential scholar,

 abandoned yet thirty years on, The Oxford

 Dictionary of New Zealand English first appeared,

 penned by an academic of that selfsame city.

 We are the last of the witnesses Geoff, like the

 derelicts who took the sun sitting behind the Public

 Library, or sheltered in Pigeon Park, days long

 gone (along with THE DUKE and THE GRAND

 HOTEL) a city newly syllabled, yet the light remains,

 much the same milky white and pale as stone.

 Hotel Diligencias

 In Veracruz

 dusk troubles with a scent of

 gardenias after the last tramcar passes by,

 and the rocking chairs begin their

 small breeze-making on the balconied

 terraces between the family photographs

 and little statues.

 The dancing couples revolve at an angle

 in the great brewery mirrors marked:

 Cerveza Moetezuma

 before the globes lighting the plaza

 die out at 9:30 pm sharp.

 But this was

 Villahermosa.

 Lightning burns like mescal in

 the throat of night.

 The whisky priest skulks about

 the mountain roads where you are headed, at

 Chiapas or Las Casas, charging so many

 pesos per baptism in the illegal night.

 With or without him thrive the false

 saints & miracles in these remote regions,

 pure homage to superstition.

 O comfort of Poverty! O lie of Pleasure!

 You recalled the hot seaport,

 your departure planned on the Ruiz Cano

 that dangerous barge which took you

 out over the Gulf of Mexico

 away from the anger hidden in laughter,

 from the pistilleros lounging by

 the Presidencia.

 You the too curious

 gringo left behind you the coasting steamers

 & pink squared plazas to forget the

 taste of warm beer in dreary cantinas.

 You headed for the high ground

 of Tabasco & the country of ruined churches.

 Back at the beginning

 of those lawless

 roads lie the dingy houses smearing out onto

 silver sandhills.

 Wardrobe Drinkers

 is what they are in Austinmer.

 Yuppies from the North Shore, $300,000

 homes on the beach front, sending

 the RSL broke & the greenies

 blocking development for a few birds

 up an estuary. Could be worse,

 given the Japs on the Gold Coast

 going off like mobile phones.

 The miners & cottages are long gone &

 so is full employment. In 1941

 as a telegraph delivery boy I made

 13 shillings 10 a week. Across

 the Harbour Bridge to the North Shore

 on a regulation red bike. Sunday

 was the day for casualty messages,

 the dead & wounded delivered

 all over Sydney except Vine street,

 Darlington, where Darcy the Crim lived

 & the most dangerous place in town.

 I came to Austinmer 30 years ago

 before the Wardrobe Drinkers

 in the days of the miners & cottages.

 Take those grain & coal carriers

 upwards of 250,000 tonnes with a 12

 man crew, anchored stern to wind,

 off Hill 60 out of Port Kembla

 navigated by satellite direct to Japan.

 You want the best view? Sublime Pt.

 Lookout, right down the coast, the

 Pacific ironed flat far as the eye can

 see, a sky expanded metal-red nightly.

 Girl. Gold. Boat

 out of Port Moresby. The obese

 Oxford villain tumbles overboard

 speared by the fuzzy-wuzzies. Our

 hero, Captain Singleton, finally

 puts his shirt back on and tilts

 his cap to the sunset. He places one

 arm around his sweetheart and the

 other at the helm. The sea falls into

 suburbs of light, a topiary of

 Islands could be mist. He is American

 and at home in the world as he

 moves forward on the celluloid tides.

 He came out of sickness country

 (sic) he came out of the Holy Land.

 Domestic Pack Shots

 

 The Gays Next Door

 

 shrieking like hyenas in

 their sexual mirth to the disco

 bang of Madonna making her

 mint in the sacrilegious from the

 sacred. For some, perhaps, a

 continuous custom to hang together

 whatever sense of family may

 be had once the wild oats

 have passed into the photograph album:

 circa: June, in some tumbled month,

 the garden hose spurting champagne

 and the neighbour, suspect as

 an affair, out of shot.

 2. Working Hot

 Joe Hammer makes his move on

 screen and the girl cries out for Mamma.

 A family of sperm packs up and moves

 house. The removal of limbs.

 The images dim to an impotent mauve

 and the stage act begins. Shes

 only working warm, consistent as a

 vibrator. She hopes one day

 to make big bucks; the conference

 room, that is, before she hits twenty.

 The one spotlight fixes on

 the portico between her thighs.

 The audience soughs in the dark. Strippers

 dont have no union, strippers dont.

 O Karen, your smile, cool as a cucumber.

 3. Hooking For Jesus

 Let us sing the rosellas who

 buckle under branches for the paper-bark

 blossom, and the far distant shadows

 on slate-roofs. Let us herald the

 Children of God, the Family of Love,

 progeny of the Jesus Freaks founded in

 Oakland, California back in the 70s.

 And this child, who believes

 Bethlehem resides in her fourteen year

 old womb. Hers is the pioneering

 spirit caught in a spectral watercolour.

 There she leans, under the guiding

 star of a single streetlight, while

 bluestone clouds move away over

 St Kilda into yellow, polite paddocks.

 4. The Priest Across The Lane

 in the presbytery is maxed out

 from the exo-bike, beads of sweat drip

 off his fingertips. He is purged

 of the last house-boy from the

 jungle parish in Papua New Guinea, ten

 years previous. He pounds at the

 peck-deck in his lounge room

 wishing the garden hand were an opera

 singer. Several repeats of the

 pole-twists and his bowels grunt like a

 sermon. A final glass of claret drops

 him to his knees ashen faced. His

 big bath steams plump now, full

 as the Jordan river. The one bedroom

 light burns on the lemon bush

 which holds its globes of fruit like

 a juggler stopped mid-trick.

 Chelmsford Street, Newtown, Sydney

 5. Corruption Is Glorified Mateship

 Its Bastille Day in Sydney.

 The weird man in the moon falls to the

 night basket. Stars roll out

 another lottery and unemployment raises

 dust over the land. Tout est perdu

 fors lhonneur. Among thieves.

 Running with images I whirl out the

 rainbow. Spring flutters as the National

 flag to salute the pilot whales

 herding one more disastrous landing.

 Waves roll head-to-head round

 the plate of The Great South Land.

 Which way to Wynyard, calls

 the currawong. Helicopters line up like

 magi over Bankstown. When you

 look up, that old full moon makes you

 feel like a cowpoke, dont it?

 6. Inner City Camping Blues

 under a dusty-hulled moon out

 of an empty Hollywood lot placed there

 in the out-take of twilight. The

 bus families have arrived in convoy.

 Stolidly parked nearby in protest

 at two suburban parks up for auction in

 a depressed market. A couple of

 pitched tents and an Information Stand

 of press clippings. Kids play in a

 refuse pit between tossed aside railway

 sleepers. Slung about the Council

 Chambers fairy lights all a twinkle since

 the last bi-election a year back;

 not much in this, not even a picnic.

 Tarts & Takeaways

 is what hes into, he said &

 thats fine by me (William street in

 winter and pissing down is the pits)

 standing around in doorways waiting

 for some totally wasted guy excuse me!

 its a trick is what it is to

 slap his dumb meat between my thighs.

 Hey, Im Jasmine though I dont

 feel like one. Mostly bored.

 On each hip Ive got this tattoo, says

 Allan kind of smudgy & out of focus

 because its real old. The main

 man. A jerk off really in someone

 elses life. A lifer. Summers

 shit, more noise and especially groups.

 For hours or however long it takes

 & I do Spanish & French, but Im

 better at French. Sometimes not much

 happens. Idle as a lizard pointing

 brickwork on hot buildings, someone said.

 I read in this magazine once,

 (I meet all sorts) and this guy

 says, nor can I say I love you

 but a gentle calligraphy informs your

 brow. What a whacker! I know shit

 from clay, he just reckoned he could get

 away with saying nothing. Dickhead!

 Guys are like that with money

 like its some fucking secret.

 Who Killed Brett Whiteley

 Actually, it was Lloyd Rees

 killed off Brett Whiteley who couldnt

 live the promise of old age,

 the calm terror of it. Thats what

 Rees meant in his letter to Brett:

 carry the torch forward

 and something about being a warrior

 for Art. Brett, in fact, was

 skittled by a high powered mix of

 narcissism & clown. Forget what

 he had to, or couldnt leave behind &

 anything to do with High Seriousness.

 He got caught up in latitudes

 of sex where the Olgas loomed round as

 buttocks. Brett became his own

 myth when he died, and effectively

 slammed the door on the 60s.

 Maybe some other seascape, like Thera,

 suggestive of broken altars;

 looking down into the cratered harbour

 he might have seen beneath the

 lapis lazuli waters, an ivory

 scimitar held in the gaze of Portunus,

 perfectly preserved, snapped in two.

 Sugarbag Carpenter

 Them days all you

 needed was a blunt saw &

 an axe thrown in a

 sack. If you could

 drive a 3" nail through a

 pound of butter

 you got the job

 and thats a fact ask

 Bob the Builder

 who shook the hand

 of Banjo Patterson though

 no-one believes him.

 Theres not one

 finial or mullion round

 Boomi that hasnt

 his name on it;

 he was there with the ox

 & swivel chain.

 When he couldnt

 make a deaner he went bumper

 shooting in the 30s

 way back before

 the Great War the first of the

 street kids in Ultimo,

 and his father

 (hell tell you) saw electricity

 come to Tamworth in 1888.

 From Tilba Tilba

 to Bondi, the last of the

 Sugarbag Carpenters.

 Aunty Eve

 who always kept the Aspidistras

 flying high up in her Georgian house on

 the windy Terrace from marble urns

 had lipstick bomber pilot red

 & nails the colour of flame.

 It was often elevenses in her lounge

 with Gordons served on a silver platter and

 THE GRAND HOTEL, DUNEDIN 1932 engraved

 on the rim. Another stim dear?

 from the mahogany sideboard repository to dozens

 of weighty 78 jazz records in brown paper

 jackets stacked like so many ossified flapjacks.

 Oh she had the most beautiful hands (in her

 day) they said, used for commercials in the

 Womens Weekly & Booths the Chemists.

 Who could forget her gravel voice & make up

 mannequin thick

 not remember her gin-sweet

 breath warm upon the neck? And how some Yank

 billeted during WW2 (here) ducky!

 thought she was a real living doll.

 Oh such beautiful hands she had & the crystal light

 streaming forth from those great bay windows

 onto the iron railings below.

 Harold Lloyd

 is stridently hanging on for

 dear life from the Big Clock hand

 reading 12:30 twenty floors up in NYC

 dangling a gibbet jig on the ledge

 beneath his girl with the bob cut

 screaming soundlessly as he catapults

 past the big businessman whose fist

 is foreclosed like a bank on their

 undying love which against all odds is

 saved as he grabs at the flagpole

 angled stark as an erection from the

 side of the building on the way through

 the office window only to upset the

 cooler and startle the typing pool

 then back down the zigzag emergency

 exit skittling the fire-bucket to snatch

 the fire-hose & bungy jump down

 the side of the skyscraper while the

 keystone cops are toppling in omnibuses

 furiously toward the wrong address

 at odds with the clanging fire brigade

 a cavalry charge amongst a confusion

 of ladders & outsize helmets

 pointing the way into the fray

 continuously as down drops Harold free

 falling as only a spider can to be

 pulled up short one foot from the side

 walk under the canopied foyer entrance

 as darling thing hurtles into

 the stripy canvas awning where Harold

 catches her in his stiff upheld arms to

 the astonished joy of the hotel porter

 Conrad & Wells & Co.

 Great to have met Joseph Conrad

 or for that matter, HG Wells, who said,

 Lets go upstairs and do nice things

 with our bodies, and who did just

 that to take a tilt at the waitress.

 I saw them once, Conrad & Wells, in

 a photograph, standing together.

 A courtyard setting beside a few bamboo

 chairs. The hour was mild in a black

 & white afternoon. Trees, too,

 green galleons shipping oars in Autumn.

 Conrad had, perhaps, cast off the last line

 of a novel: the indigo lump upon the

 horizon is an Island: behind it the sun

 spilling its treasure trove: the rent

 sailcloth of a sea-squall. Anyway,

 he could still smell the coast wobble from

 the deck of the Tartane, her weight

 to the wind. Wells, maybe, was thinking on

 socialism & science, and in some

 melancholic way of the waitress, she all

 ascent. By what conversations did

 they measure each other, these two voyagers

 who possessed that sense of the bigness

 of the world? For Wells, an electrical

 spark that arced across the white page, and

 for Conrad, each word creaking on

 the blocks, the woman pale before the moon,

 her eyes black as tornadoes at sea.

 Hoppalong Cassidy

 nearly topples as the Jaffas rumble

 down the aisle escarpment which in no way

 disturbs Bully Boy in the back seat

 corner of the matinee session on a Saturday

 afternoon flick with it might be Bus Stop

 Bev with one leg hooked in surrender

 over the front seat that youd think shes

 getting shod or something judging by the

 whinnying which could be some sort of scuffle

 but then Hoppy regains the ground & the

 white Arabian stallion muscling to middle

 screen his ten-gallon hat gum stuck atop

 his head & his pearl handled six shooters

 bristling at each hip as he thunders

 round the dusty back lot who has just saved

 the stage coach with the backward spinning

 wheels out of last weeks cliffhanging

 disaster when over it went packed with

 the good townsfolk but it didnt all saved by

 the man in the black velvet with the silver

 studs & turkey gobble voice much to the hand

 pumping appreciation of the circuit judge

 too old to take the high jump & this

 real paternal dude takes it in his stride

 is off next week in search of the Lost

 Dutchmans Gold Mine as legend has it but

 not for long while Bully Boy will be

 back sweaty as a farrier with Lemonade Lil

 to catch what he can with Hoppy sure

 is a friend indeed when a friends in need

 Bob Orr

 I called back down the unawakened

 dawn of the Tasman sea and along the East

 Coast from the pre-dawn light of

 my sleep, I called out Bob Orr

 soft as the punch of a howitzer to the

 Hokianga harbour & still further over the

 Waikatos billiard-table green paddocks.

 I hailed Bob to the Great Barrier

 Island & Orr to the Little Barrier,

 but no answer came chasing after. I

 sought you down the Harbour Heads &

 Hauraki Gulf then all about the Waitemata.

 I found a Thunderhead big as a

 container-load of sorrows & nowhere hard

 by were you toiling. Bob Orr I

 called from Meola Reef to the outlandish

 fishing-tackle cranes along the docks;

 to Jellicoe wharf, Bledisloe wharf,

 Marsden wharf, Captain Cook wharf to the

 Admiralty Steps hoping I would find

 you gazing out upon the glaucous slick of

 trawlers, or catch you guiding a snubnosed

 tug under the Western Viaduct.

 Bob Orr I called down the unending

 roadsteads to Motutapu & Rakino Islands,

 back behind the wave screen at Okahu Bay

 to Freemans and St Marys Bay. And as

 I called into the Schooner Tavern &

 sought the drear interior of the Wynyard

 Tavern & the sailors talk told me

 you had fitted and trimmed your craft

 against every dire prediction to set sail

 on that other sea, Bob, the one that

 has no name & no horizon & is drowning you.

 Dave Spencer

 lived his life like barbed-wire

 is what an old girlfriend said, man of

 the river. But then, life finished you

 off bit-by-bit though couldnt pluck out

 your dingo-bright eyes. Lets face it,

 you were pretty much an arse-hole

 to those who knew you. Most of us just

 bash the trees without seeing the kangaroos.

 You saw living mostly for what it is,

 a part-time job with bugger all security;

 the occasional softness of a woman,

 maybe, and of course grog by the bucketful.

 What was it you saw at the last, Dave,

 when passing through the ripped canvas of a

 thunderstorm, lightning flashing down the

 Hawkesbury, a good belt of rain after?

 You Dont Remember Dying

 least, thats what the Old Londoner

 told me who didnt learn to relax till well

 past fifty, seated alongside his two

 mates: a Norwegian: Youre not the same

 person now as you were ten years ago.

 And the Irishman: I like the music its

 the noise I cant stand. Each one,

 orphaned & aphoristic, deep into his sixties.

 NZ born and much younger, I offered:

 Youre not the same person tomorrow as

 you were today. And then, To your

 arrival in Melbourne, they singly toasted.

 (Great-grandfather, MacCormack, arrived

 here in 1851 & 26 years later, in 1877, set

 sail for Dunedin aboard the Ringarooma).

 So our tale of the two cities unfolded:

 Sydney is get what you can. Melbourne,

 what have you got to offer & are we really

 interested. The afternoon floated by

 as did the trams with dry, asthmatic rush

 in this mellow town of bungalows & brass.

 Graham Clifford

 After THE DUKE HOTELs demolition,

 (opp. Perretts Corner) one last joke: one DB

 beer bottle ringed by ten green cabbages

 as roseate or wreath for an empty lot. Close by,

 the mad bucketing fountain of Cuba Mall

 played on. Meanwhile, at his Manners street

 studio above the music shop, Graham

 Clifford, renowned for his Figaro, ululated

 profoundly through the scales. A window framed

 trolley-bus poles that, tacking, flared bluely

 along the wire. The maestros voice floated

 over harbour & city, capital & far-flung country,

 far from Covent Garden. A 1930s London

 partied on amongst black & white photographs

 plastered to the wall above a battered Steinway.

 On Brooklyn hills toi toi waved war plumes

 to the southerly gusts with unceasing applause.

 Through a hundred, sunblown wintry afternoons

 he coached opera singers, actors, newsreaders,

 plucked notes off the yellow stained keys:

 he guided, rolled golden vowels, before them.

 Bruno Lawrence

 Bruno, do you remember the Me and Gus stories,

 way before Barry Crump got keen, when a cow cocky

 was a bastard you met on gravelly roads? Recall

 the nights playing community halls, and days making

 a few records, only to break a few more? Ricky

 Mays Jazz Combo, Max Merritt & The Meteors,

 Quincy Conserve, plus, the all-stars-road-show

 Blerta1, travelling Aotearoa, through khaki paddocks,

 down thistle blown highways in that diesel bus t

 seasonal rhythms you doubtless gathered, drummer

 extraordinaire, on your final journeying off Cape

 Reinga, the spirit freed to ride the rain you backed

 the loner to the last, death the bottom line to stave

 off cancer. Bruno, you did that thing. R & B, jazzman,

 film star (didnt Jack Nicholson say get on over

 to Hollywood?) but you preferred back blocks, sought

 small towns, river shingle, the hollows of the land,

 and a home around Waimarama in the Hawkes Bay.

 A shifting romantic, hoon & hangman, a real joker

 you played yourself sans bullshit in a heap of movies;

 The Wild Man, Ute, you leapt from life to art

 without a hitch; A Bridge To Nowhere, The Quiet

 Earth, how you loved women, warmth by the bus load,

 produced that classic my 12 inch, record of the blues.

 1 Bruno Lawrences Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition.

 The Still Watches

 I

 Autumn tinsel floats gold on

 July leaves and up goes the memory

 flare. The carbon rod of winter

 burns low and the dark is a mammoth

 locked within ice. Watch the simultaneous

 reels of the seasons spinning before

 your eyes. A plane passes, and

 upsets the late sun to a shadow-print

 upon the wall. With barely a

 movement we come from the bleaker months

 to where the picture pans briefly,

 dissolves upon the softer ores

 of spring. Ah, but the Captains of

 Industry are wheeling! A building boom

 amongst the trees after the first

 few casual blossoms had fallen along

 suburban driveways. Observe the birds

 investing in the green shares of September.

 This side of the documentary we

 view in armchair safety, Our Planet:

 a well heeled cloud pads across

 the moons surface, under the

 vast drift-net of the night tuna boats

 swing light probes about the arresting

 waters another country claims.

 David Attenborough journeys through

 deserts to break the ancient limestone

 tablets, and proclaim that fossils

 are the visual memory of stone.

 We observe in awe the Environmental

 Mysteries and ask, is the suns bald glare

 through the Glory Hole truly the

 pointing finger of God? Laurence Olivier

 puts on his final mask, looking

 deathly, Tell my friends that I

 miss them, and then fades from the

 ramparts. I name two from the camp

 of Good Attitude, builders of the beauty

 of this planet the givers, not takers

 who direct our gaze upward from the

 burning footlights of the closing century,

 toward the language of our Common Future.

 II

 The seeing wears away the seer:

 twelve years further on Voyager 2 putts

 out through the pinball solar

 system, past Neptune and beyond the

 reach of time. Another day in

 the round and the cliche of uneventful

 incident has not yet arrived.

 The balloon that is so majestic on

 the plump air tumbles as heavy

 as a plumb-bob onto the countryside,

 trailing its fifty seconds of life

 huddled to impact. The cattle

 scattered, the sky did not change but

 released names into the wispy

 afternoon. Then all is as it was

 before the tragic flight, except

 the calm that betokens fear.

 And clouds rich as coalmines gathered

 from the chutes of mountainsides, over

 the belts of grainfield to boost

 the corporate climates, and to market

 each end of the world gyrally.

 A blotting paper sky, the soft

 tear of thunder, then lightning. Who

 would demand of the wise a word

 to steer by? Nostradamus throws his

 hands in the air after the event:

 Mark well my words, I told you so.

 Backward we look upon his bag

 of tricks, and with each new calamity

 a surreal rabbit lifts before your eyes.

 Ribbed streets! Pneumatic heartbeat!

 Prophecy is the Art of Boredom

 for one who cannot stand his own company

 from one moment to the next.

 He pulls the hat trick, feigns the

 future, argues the task of his breath

 wearily on its way. Some ravel

 dreams to cats cradles in whose

 uninhabited solitude, slowly as a yawn,

 wish to pull forth the superstrings.

 Call it a living, this space

 between meetings. Those encirclements

 that bind us together temporally.

 The distant applause of rain

 and the weekend screaming of a girl.

 The screech of a trains brake

 as if a fire were being extinguished.

 The exiles brain is a frozen, grey

 sea-storm; from wave to wave

 he stares down the barrel of the moon.

 It is morning and the sun spreads

 over Nicaragua slow as the slitting

 of a throat. Consider Ernesto Cardinal

 as he rises from his bed, how

 he stacks his images practical as planks.

 Ay, the roses blood dark as diesel!

 VI

 He will come urgent as a food

 riot. Beware the man who sheds tears of

 mercury. His cough alone will thin

 out the ozone. He grips oceans with

 the black fingers of trawlers.

 His voice is a slow leakage in the Third

 World Night. Beware the Waste-Broker.

 He comes to paint your wellsprings

 ivory black and chrome yellow. You will

 know him by his industrial oath:

 $40 a drum! yes, only $40 a drum!

 Senegal, Nigeria, West Africa,

 the sun dangerous as a forty-gallon drum.

 Drums stacked on rotting pallets

 in the back yard of tropical forests.

 Drums swollen like the bellies

 of starved children with toxic waste.

 The Berlin Wall is falling down,

 each chunk a souvenir sponsored by

 Smirnoff. Who was that poet who

 whispered, Death is a maestro from

 Germany. Away in America,

 Raymond Carver, as the provinces of

 his body revolted, gasped our

 daily losses from ruined lungs. It

 comes down to love, he said.

 What we hear is anger in its orbit.

 Falling piano notes. The last

 of the rain down brickwork. Guttering

 full. Something like sounds of

 water hitting a serving dish. A couple

 of taps. Its that hour. A train,

 of course, fading in and out of suburbs.

 Time running off everywhere.

 George Moore shuts his green door

 against the catholic glare of Ireland.

 A sense of things erased. The whole

 night sliding down. Lamplight.

 Gumleaves as strips of plastic bright

 through a casual breeze. What can

 later researchers make of this,

 the Age of Rapidity? Things made which

 had small use then cast aside.

 The mirage of modern love. Something

 swapped for something else. Made better.

 And that charge of energy

 varicose-veined as lightning, a little

 kindness left to hover, unquestioned?

 We know it as we get older.

 V

 O Bougainville! Flying foxes

 plentiful as copper, gone in a waste

 of tailings from the Island,

 forever. The most pure black race on

 earth in jungle fatigues armed

 against the ravages of the Corporates,

 wading the chemical rivers,

 a cackle of gunfire to make the ABC

 stringers dispatch. But not the

 words of Randolph Stow: VISITANTS:

 My body is a house and some

 visitor has come. My house is echoing

 with the footsteps of the visitor.

 My house is bleeding to death.

 O Bougainville! Your burnished blood

 flows from the split chest of

 Treasure Island. An opencast land

 and an overcast sky. I think

 of my mother and her breastbone

 snapped back. A row of Xs marks it.

 The sky: one vast, curving blue

 wave. Blue was; then painted itself

 into Time, sang Rafael Alberti

 to the Bay of Cadiz. The day

 a slow melting cube of ice. Bright

 coldness of frost on the window,

 in the silence, late at night.

 The level rhythm of the taxi

 down the street of streaming lights.

 III

 Who can offer words unsullied

 by the Age like the sad integrity of

 a Graham Greene? Generations

 pass on into unchartered waters, the

 lights out along the deck.

 Behind, the floodlit logging of

 Malaysia gluts the Japanese market.

 Ahead, seals choke in the heavy metal

 swell of the Baltic sea;

 or through a destiny as choppy as a

 Berryman sonnet, the earth

 seemed unearthly in a hold of love lashed to

 the bulkheads of youth one time,

 O it was sometime ago. But now,

 the hour hangs out centre stage, a

 cat whiskered moon doffs into

 darkness and ushers in a Qantas Jumbo

 to Kingsford Airport, down the runway

 to Eastern Standard Time, and a

 continent the memory of elsewhere.

 Welcome tourists to the whirl

 of Kings Cross, a caged fan spinning

 the night through, shredding the

 Sydney Dreamers. Out along THE WALL

 you can solicit your nightlong

 visas where the bare chested boys

 thrust hips from the bonnets

 of old Holdens. High up on the

 bulging stonework & boldly sprayed:

 Its going to rain tonight, so

 take a bullet proof vest; and,

 No war on the way, only a change in

 the weather. Welcome the

 eagle-eyed predators come to roost

 in the coops of the cities.

 Let us go down to the docks again to

 the fat silos that overshadow

 Iron Cove Bridge, toward the innerharbour,

 where craft coloured

 and alive on the paintbox waterways

 streak around and about, caught

 up against the shark-net constructions

 of Patrick White. Welcome the waves

 of early morning fog that break

 upon the sky-gardens, and the iron clad

 poppy of Centre Point Tower.

 IV

 Lights ablaze in the House of

 Europe, and the Party rolls from room

 to room: Poland, Romania, Germany,

 the black triangle of Czechoslovakia.

 You can walk Europe comfortably with a

 plastic shopping bag, Western

 Europe, that is, forests and country

 neatly manicured. A Sunday

 stroll sort of feeling. In Eastern

 Europe you can do the same thing

 though must lift your steps higher,

 over the rubble, that is.

 Under the red copper basin of the sun,

 under the broken crockery of stars,

 Senegal, Nigeria, West Africa.

 Meanwhile, George MacDonald flees

 the Evil Wood through the unreflecting

 mirror of 19th-century time, a

 prophet of the cinema. O cine-romance!

 Tony Curtis (sword glint of light

 off teeth) and Natalie Wood, beautiful

 in white tulle (lungs not yet waterlogged)

 in heady love. Follow their laughter

 with an open-topped Lagonda down the

 white-walled mountain roads of Mt. Aetna

 to the Port of Catania in a blood-boiling

 swerve to the red-chequered table,

 and the fishing boats in the blue dusk.

 Woody Allen steps from the screen

 to the dead crystal lakes of Sweden. A

 floppy disc of moon lies reflected

 there in an Excalibur beam of light.

 Clouds, too. Those ancient purities

 across my triptych window-view-of-the-sky

 package air as light as styrofoam.

 The lighthouse beam chills the sandhills

 and oceans gather up whale breath to

 cloud. Our civilisation bartered on the

 whales back. Love undrinkable as water.

 The silent film of fantasy which is night

 plays out through the ivory keys of stars.

 VII

 Abe Nathan dons black and says:

 Nor shall I change the colour of my

 dress until peace is declared in Israel.

 He flies over Egypt to bomb Cairo

 with flowers. The scent dispersed upon

 the breeze the breath of the PLO.

 He would dream the muffled explosions

 in ancient streets the thunder

 of looms and the moon over the Sinai

 a Lady of Gallant Memory. He would dream

 the sun a copper scroll, and of peace

 perfumed with cedar and cypress, of

 pomegranate, bitter herbs and balsam.

 The thought that catches in the

 throat wakes him the shout of

 Iraq. I will waste half your country

 with flame. He wakes to the taste

 of Saddam Husseins binary spittle, rips

 his garments in grief. In this clear

 cut country, snap your fingers,

 watch sound bounce off rock. He dreams

 that one profound thought unspoken

 will change the minds of humankind.

 O America! a poet is a detective

 shadowing himself. Dashiell Hammett,

 your success too late, success too soon.

 You didnt find sufficient fog in San

 Francisco to cover as the Great American Op.

 The McCarthy era burned you off

 from the 50s, left the last twenty years

 of your life a shredded, dud cheque,

 the profound terror of the final breath

 made thin the man you knew. Patriot

 to the country which disowned you, your

 last gasp became that of a silencer.

 America, you try to cheer yourself up

 but youre too easy on yourself.

 Watch the coral reefs off Johnstons atoll

 grow the black scabs of car tires.

 Watch Hectors dolphin drown in

 the gill-nets off Banks Peninsula.

 From the North Sea watch the slick seals

 wash up dead on the Island of Texel.

 Watch the Pacific united all around us

 lie snug and blue as a body bag.

 VIII

 Surgical strike of the stars at

 the Persian Gulf. Romance of the World!

 How deadly our longing for peace

 on this earth round as an Ideal.

 Delicately, we remember WW2 bombers

 romanced in archival film-footage like

 forks tossed across a transformer dark sky.

 David Niven steps lightly under the

 arched stone bridge, he brushes

 the dust of a crushed building from

 fingertips by the flares of a London

 sky. Childhood is the last-chance gulch

 for happiness, he says. Havel

 plays the Pied-Piper astride his multicoloured

 cavalcade. A wave of the

 hand old-fashioned as anger, and he goes

 home to the Democratic Mountain,

 civilly. Salman Rushdie rides the magic

 carpet quicker than Qantas. The World

 is surreal, he cries, tis no more

 than a game of hide-and-seek,

 and whizzes past into the future.

 Lange gleefully corks the evil jinnee of

 Baghdad, then flies onto the green embrace

 of Aotearoa with the freed twelve.

 Where once the melancholy bombs

 from heaven fell to glut a village, 1000

 grey cranes have returned to the Mekong

 Delta in the month of pure light.

 One herd of elephants also returned to

 the tropical jungle where before

 was none. A pure green is that light

 and not the green of crouching camouflage.

 I bend to my past, for there is

 a corner of the sky forever my childhood:

 Rupert Brooke frolics through the

 soft Edwardian light with Virginia, and

 dreams of fish-heaven. Bad William

 thumps the shit out of poor Aunty Ethel.

 Every poem is the last will &

 testament of the soul, and every lover

 who breaks from lover a crime unto

 passion. Romance of the World!

 IX

 Sun shines metallic off Footscray

 and out across Westgate bridge. Silver &

 green office blocks rise from a

 dun plain. Superman, bearing a stash of

 old money darts over the dockside

 and the hidden sea home to Melbourne.

 The thought of you adds weight

 to new memory sad as lamplight on rain

 sodden guttering. Sadder still is the

 Romantic lapsed to obscenity,

 the swine tides that clog the spirit.

 Again, I drive my centre to the eye

 of your hurricane. Remember how

 the senses wrangled, anger like a vicious

 exorcism of betrayals not worded?

 To run is to hide is to freely admit the

 hidden hurt. Volscian woman, we flung our

 fire at each other heavy as fists.

 The old man sits in the park feeding

 pigeons; like his memories, they are

 grey-blue and flutter about him.

 My memory of you from any perspective falls

 along the flat face of this earth.

 No lamp lit up our consciousness,

 only the blade figured the light, Psyche.

 The funeral of the sea

 sings the Italian documentary. The

 worlds rotting oil-fleet blanks

 out the Mediterranean from the French

 coast to the Bay of Naples. Six

 hundred burning black candles turn crude

 the Arab night and Red Adair pots

 another well. Oil Magnates!

 Corporate Cowboys! Have you built your

 little ship of death, O have you?

 And there in the deep the Great Underwater

 Colonialist, Jacques Cousteau, laments

 the dark night of the sea, his

 eyes are the colour of basalt.

 Today we have part-time cloud & the

 hours work at it cruel as barbed wire drawn

 across the face of the moon.

 What then is this other? It is

 the shadow personality, evil comes from

 the power of evil. It is the third

 presence. O Romance of the World.

 X

 Crack of whips in substations

 and the horizon lights up like a

 Lucas/Spielberg movie. Tonight toward

 Blacktown helicopters make astrological

 moves sideways. Earlier, a trailblazer

 made one Caesarean cut along the western

 sky. The 6 Oclock news brought with

 it race riots & rapes, an eclipse

 of weather which threatened the following

 day, the unsteady peace of tomorrow.

 60 million hectares of saliferous

 planet, and a new desert creeps toward

 Central Europe. There is salt in

 the wound of the earth. Closer now comes

 the yearly pilgrimage with candle-flame

 of lava to light up Mt. Fuji in ninetynine

 turns of the track. Refuse

 of light and all that glitters. As the

 Stealth Bomber slides East night advances

 swift-footed over the Empire, over

 the roll-call of the New World Order.

 Watch the southern sky shuffle

 the South China sea & galaxies thick as

 krill. Japanese fishing boats stack

 the decks with amputated fins by the tonne.

 Sharks loll dumb as torpedoes on waters

 flenched in blood. The Yugoslav

 Republics grow tired and another 25

 frames of tankfire roll off the screens

 from Croatia. Pain is the visible

 urge to memory, says the Anchorperson.

 Radio KGB hits the airwaves with

 a global countdown from Tass and Reuter

 & AAP. Back in Ontario, escalators whisper

 to the underground shopping plazas

 and the Gallic snows fall loudest on Quebec.

 Frost at midnight lies as silent as

 The American Dream, and all along

 the border night moves. This train

 dont run no more this train. Yo! This

 train dont run no more and Canadas

 cut in half, calls David Suzuki. Hush now,

 the cyber-freaks sleep. Soundlessly,

 the Hubble telescope gears its focus.

 XI

 An extended mobile of galaxies.

 A prided installation. The dark, invisible

 matter of a riot in L.A. Three thousand

 buildings ripple out flame in the

 city of Lost Angels. And then an open sky,

 a banquet of beads after fire hoses

 roll out the light on any upright

 surface. Hollywood Hills are alive with

 the sound of security locks. The CNN

 anchor-team is too well dressed for

 the maddening flames, in the sear, ongoing

 segment of a news flash. In the break,

 gathered the rain as pure as static,

 unseen, but imagined whitely and curfew-wide.

 Along the crippled streets in the blood

 blare of sirens, night arrived under

 the guise of the National Guard.

 Heat rises from the grid of these sidewalks

 and the spirits of the Indian, afraid

 enough of death to die, whoop it

 up around the big campfires. I wake,

 uncomfortable in the lurk of a dream, and

 my breath draws up hope like an

 anchor, lifts my thoughts into the day where

 I follow. Let us go (you & I) into

 the glow, hand in hand with Virtual Reality

 and idly make up war-games. Let us pray

 that a supreme silence will be down-loaded

 at last. Moonrise, and a luminant coal

 sifts through the western grate of the world.

 In cornfields elsewhere, so remembered

 though not so high as an elephants eye,

 images pressed round as a hotplate

 suggest some mystery or midnight vigil;

 this is what we wish, to stamp threat onto

 the inexplicable, seeking out totems

 and to hold the dance of the primitive sacred:

 this city, too, let it stand as Icon.

 XII

 O to wish upon a falling space

 shuttle! The sky tries hard to reveal

 itself as bluestone, but temperature and

 wrappings of cloud are against it.

 Rain falls hard as luck. Here you will

 see them lift up, a squadron of

 pigeons swinging to gun the light, wings

 ablaze, the bulky horizon thunderous

 where thunder lies cognisant.

 The Great Dividing Range runs this way

 and I am on the leeside toward the

 sea. The setting sun awakens our

 ancestral demand for bonfires

 big as cities, and a leisurely parade

 of gulls passing overhead mistake

 the darkening hours for seacliffs.

 These coastal towns boast the best burgers,

 the newest surf club while the RSL

 bends to the heavy metal swell which

 runs the raft of every sea-slap

 every weekend. The short, broad streets

 are abandoned early to the blue

 phosphorescence of the TV and the evening

 rustle of newspapers. Tomorrow,

 of course, is uninhabited and fresh as a

 childs drawing. Further on through

 the minutes someone is hard at a hammer as

 if wanting to be let in. A news

 bulletin tells of avenues long as decades

 in a steepled town where tanks gather,

 ready to break through a hay barn

 in Kosovo. (Remember the Revolutionary

 Poet who broke through a crowd?)

 No, this is only a rusted keel upended

 in the quarter-acre back yard. Not

 by some turbulence round Cape Horn but

 the tedium of a bankrupt dream loose as a

 cloud. The family seams have now sprung

 apart and the kids school the public

 bars. A day in the round for the father who

 breaks through the top-shelf like a

 picket-line. At the local cinema watch the

 astronaut yawn, unaware the alien

 prepares to storm the spaceport wordless as

 a threat. Its dusk here, mist drowns

 streetlights, the earth for a time puts aside

 its hunger, and a delayed flight

 fills in for the evening star of Autumn.

Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

 collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

 Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed. VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

 http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

 EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date. If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.

 http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

 (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,

 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

 EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way. The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path. The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename). The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename. For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

 http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

 or filename 24689 would be found at:

 http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
