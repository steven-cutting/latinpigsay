 Chapter One

 : A Bad Beginning for a Birthday

 Cat woke in darkness. Something had changed. Something was new and different and strange.

 She glanced at the window. The stars were bright above the streetlights. A raven flew away from the sill with a soft fluttering. That wasn't what woke her. Ravens often perched on the tower of Casa Medianoche.

 She sat up, shivering as the blanket slid from her shoulders. The shadows in her room were familiar. The high posts of the old Spanish bed that had been her mother's had never frightened her--when she was little, her father had said they were guards named John, Paul, George, and Ringo who would protect her from any closet monster. The antique wardrobe was big enough to hide serial killers, but only if they threw out half her collection of old costumes and games. The hulking shape in the far corner was the ancient desk that had been her mother's, now topped with a computer that had been her father's. The squatting shape in the near corner was a Victorian armchair, piled with clothes and school books. Two black blurs like monstrous eyes were the doors to the stairs and the elevator. They always groaned when they opened. She would have heard anyone using them.

 The only difference in her room was barely a difference. On the far side of the bed, her best friend was sleeping soundly. Tarika often slept over. Tarika wasn't what had changed.

 Cat listened to the night. A few cars passed in the distance. A breeze rustled a palo verde tree. The city of Tucson was quiet.

 She sniffed. The air was crisp and dry, just as it was every autumn.

 The mattress shifted as Tarika lifted her head from the pillow to mumble, "Cat? Wegoddagiddupaready?"

 The clock's glowing numbers said they had an hour until sunrise. "No. Stay asleep, Tee."

 Tarika nodded. "Gub." Her head dropped into the pillow. "Yootoo."

 Cat pulled her blanket around her shoulders. It was nice having someone warm beside her. She wished she had a cat or a dog to snuggle on cool mornings. Maybe she would get one for--

 She bolted upright. "Halloween!" Tarika's eyes snapped open. "Your birthday!" Tarika flung the covers back, leaped out of bed in her yellow pullover shirt and panties, slid on her blue jeans, stepped into sea-green tennis shoes, and began tying the laces. Boys, Cat thought, are idiots. Tarika was not a tall scarecrow with hair like a black dandelion. Tarika was beautiful. Cat would give anything to look like her.

 Tarika frowned at her. "What?" "Nothing." "Did you change your mind?" "No way."

 "And you're still in bed because--?" Cat swallowed. "A little way." "What was the very first rule of our friendship?" "Share chocolate equally." "I mean, the very second." "No wimp outs. But this isn't a wimp out!" "Oh?" Cat inhaled. The best and worst thing about best friends was they knew you. "I'm not sure it's smart." "Like stupid has stopped us before?" Cat nodded. "Every time." Tarika said, "Big stupid stops us. Ordinary stupid, never." "This might be big stupid." "What's the worst that could happen?" "I trip in the dark, you try to catch me, we fall off the roof and break our necks, and I feel like a loser forever." "I promise to let you fall." Tarika crossed her heart, then tossed Cat's purple hoodie, black jeans, and low purple boots to her. "Better?" "What if I trip into you and we both fall? And lightning hits us in midair, killing us instantly?" "Then you won't feel like a loser." "What if--" "Cat, you've been climbing out that window since you were eight." "Seven." "And there's not a cloud in the sky." "If there was an earthquake--" "Girl, out of bed now, or be Little Miss Wimpypants forever." Cat bit her lip, then shrugged. "Okay, it's big wimp out time. I'm not sure I should spoil a surprise." "This isn't a surprise." Tarika yanked open Cat's wardrobe and began tossing dresses of black velvet and red silk onto the bed. The first and smallest was sized for a baby. The thirteenth and most elaborate, with black and red jewels sewn into the fabric, could still fit Cat.

 Tarika said, "This is a mystery. Every year for your birthday, somebody leaves a costume for you, and every year it's awesomer, and the only clue is a note: Para la Princesa de la Sombra. You're not supposed to spoil surprises, but you're supposed to solve mysteries."

 "They've got to be from Granny Lupe." "Why? Because de la Sombra is her last name?" "And Mama's. Evil Dad won't say any part of Mama's name." Tarika flopped down on the bed. "We got up early because you were afraid to ask Granny Lupe if she's the Halloween Fairy? Chica, you are so breaking rule number two."

 "I asked her!" "And?" "She denied it." "But you think she's lying?" "No! She would never lie to me!" "So it's someone else?"

 Cat sighed. "Yeah. I guess so." "And we aren't sneaking out yet why?" "If we catch the Halloween Fairy, they might stop. I like presents." Tarika pursed her lips, then nodded. "Okay, La Gata. It's your mystery, so it's your call." "If we don't go, will you still respect me?" "Except when I have to remind you about the wimp out." "Did I ever tell anyone you're crushing on Trick Zapia?" "Did I ever tell anyone you are?" Cat grinned. "We're like two countries who can't go to war because they would totally destroy each other." Tarika's cloud of black hair swayed as she shook her head back and forth. "Nuh-uh. We're like two countries teamed up to totally conquer the world."

 "Truth." Cat looked at the pile of costumes. When she was little, she hadn't questioned them. Christmas meant toys, and Halloween meant costumes. She was sure Granny Lupe and her father knew who the Halloween Fairy was, but when she had asked, Granny Lupe's usual grin had widened, and her father's usual scowl had deepened. Granny Lupe had said, "You'll know when the time comes," and her father had immediately said, "If the time comes."

 "If" meant she might never know. Cat said, "Tee? Friends don't let friends break the second rule."

 "Oh! Sorry. Uh, the Halloween Fairy must want to be caught, and then you'll be rewarded with the amazingest costumes ever. And diamonds and rubies. And a horse. A jet-black flying horse."

 Cat laughed as she leaped from the warm bed into the cool night air and began tugging on her clothes. "Gonna be real disappointed if there's no flying horse, Tee."

 "I'll paint you one. If you'd like." "Ex! I'll hang it by the painting of Mama." "Cat? You'll be cool if we catch whoever it is and there's no more costumes?" She nodded. "I'm too old for Halloween costumes." Tarika stared at her. "Chica, you lie like a lying liar!" "Well. I should start acting like I'm too old for Halloween costumes." "Why?"

 "Your logic fu is mighty. Let's stay hidden so the Fairy won't see us, 'kay?"

 Tarika nodded. "Our sneak fu is the best."

 Cat went to the tower window. She kept the hinges oiled so they opened silently. That was the easiest part of sneaking out. Next easiest was climbing down. The escape rungs did not shift or creak beneath her boots. The adobe walls of Casa Medianoche were old, maybe as old as Tucson itself, one year older than the United States. Every part of the house needed to be painted or repaired or replaced, except for those iron escape rungs. Every year, her father hired someone to make sure they were safe to use.

 The hardest part was passing his window. She only knew one person who had better hearing, but Granny Lupe rarely left the basement. Cat didn't have to worry about her.

 When Cat heard her father's voice, she froze on the rungs. Why was he up so early? Then she heard his words: "Since the dawn of history, people who did not conform were persecuted. Were the witches of Salem supernatural creatures to be feared, or very natural creatures to be pitied? No one knows the final truth in the story you've just heard. So, for now and perhaps forever, it must remain in the Secret Files of Professor Midnight."

 Cat peeked into the window and saw him in his wheelchair, typing at his desk, a microphone near his keyboard, a headset over his ears, his scarred face as handsome and grim as ever. He pushed the keyboard back, cleared his throat, pulled the microphone close to his mouth, and began speaking in a deeper and slower voice. "Take seven. Throughout human history, people who don't conform have been persecuted--"

 He wasn't up early. He had been up all night working on one of his stupid webcasts. Gesturing for Tarika to hurry, Cat stepped from the last rung onto the roof. She tiptoed toward the rear of the house, carefully avoiding loose and cracked tiles. At the back porch, she lowered herself over the edge, caught the column supporting the roof, climbed down to the upper porch, and then to the lower one.

 She glanced to the east. The sky was a shade lighter above the Rincon Mountains. Were she and Tarika too late to catch the Halloween Fairy? If they didn't catch the Fairy, would a new costume appear each year until Cat died of old age?

 She thought, Solving the mystery will be better than any costume, right?

 As Tarika dropped lightly to the ground, Cat started toward the front of the house. She liked being out in the late night chill. She liked the way Casa Medianoche's thick adobe walls were smooth and silver in the soft light. She could see her home as it had looked when her mother moved in with her father, when the paint was bright and new.

 She thought, I hope the Halloween Fairy has already come. No. That would disappoint Tee. But I like this, just the two of us. I hope the Halloween Fairy will come as late as possible.

 Tarika whispered, "I'm glad the Evil Dad's updating his site." "Why?" Tarika glanced at her. "It's amazing." "--ly lame," Cat added.

 "Huh? Your dad knows like every weird thing ever." "Too bad he doesn't know any normal ones. Like getting a job." "Cat, he's--" "In a wheelchair? So? There are crippled teachers and lawyers and programmers. Even a president used a wheelchair. But Evil Dad doesn't care about anything except old books and the web."

 "And you." "Yeah, right." "He's always cooking for you." "Because he's El Cheapo. And cooking is the only other thing he likes. But does he get a job in a restaurant? No way. Okay, he likes exercising, too. But does he become a coach or a physical therapist? 'Course not. That would take him away from the only things he loves."

 "Cat--"

 "Tee, it's cool. You got a mom who loves you. I've got Granny Lupe. So Evil Dad is waiting for me to graduate and get out of his life? As of tonight, there's four years left on my sentence. Then I'm legal and gone."

 "To where?"

 Cat grinned. "Depends on whether you go to L.A. to sing or New York to paint. Either way, I'm your agent. So I get ten percent of your money, fame, and boyfriends. Deal?"

 Tarika shook her head. "I won't make art for money, fame, or boyfriends."

 Cat nodded. "Which is totally why you need an agent."

 At the front of the house, Cat paused. Tarika held up a finger and tapped out the beats in the air: One. Two. On three, Cat peeked around the corner.

 She expected to see the wide front porch, a purple wicker rocking chair for Granny Lupe, a small table, and a space beside it for her father's wheelchair. She expected to see her birthday present lying on the doormat or maybe, just maybe, a friend or a stranger delivering it.

 She did not expect to see a huge white dog. In its teeth was a package wrapped in blood-red silk and tied with black cord.

 "Mine!" Cat charged up to the front stairs. "Drop it!"

 The dog opened its mouth. The bundle fell onto the porch. Cat said, "Good do--" The word died on her lips.

 Its eyes were wide and pale, a terrifying yellow. Its fur gleamed in the moonlight. Its body was lean. Its shoulders were broad and strong. Its jaw was long and lined with teeth that glistened like silver daggers.

 Not a dog, Cat thought, her heart plunging in her chest. Wolf.

 It watched her, almost patiently. It's not running away! Shouldn't it run from humans? Is it rabid? Am I too little to scare it?

 Then she thought, I'm so stupid.

 Before she could decide whether to step back slowly or whirl and run, Tarika ran up shouting, "Shoo, loco lobo! Cat's not food!"

 The wolf looked from Cat to Tarika and bared its teeth. It thinks we're funny!

 Tarika waved her arms. "Get! Or I'm calling animal control!" The wolf took a step toward them. Do we stand up straight to look bigger? Or lie down to play dead? If it's rabid, does it matter what we do?

 Cat showed her open hands and said softly, "Easy, El Lobo. We're getting out of your way. You can run off now."

 Nudging Tarika to follow, Cat backed down the steps and into the yard. The wolf studied them. Did its ears show its emotion? Or its tail? Cat couldn't tell anything about it, except it seemed too calm. She could barely breathe. If it jumps at Tee, get in its way. Why isn't it running away? Aren't wolves supposed to avoid people? It lifted its head suddenly. Cat gasped. I've gotten us killed for a stupid costume! Why didn't I let the wolf have it? As the beast bolted toward them, Cat thought, Push Tarika out of the way!

 But her legs and arms wouldn't move, and Tarika was already shoving Cat behind her, and the wolf was on them, with its huge yellow eyes and soft ghost-white fur and the gleam of fangs and a tart smell like the night and the woods that made Cat weak. As her arms and legs grew numb, she opened her mouth, knowing she wouldn't have time to scream--

 And the white wolf spun, raced across the lawn, over the wall, onto Luna Street, and into the twilight.

 Cat glanced from where the wolf had gone to Tarika, whose mouth was wide in wonder. Casa Medianoche's ironwood door was open. A small gray woman in a shapeless black dress squinted at them.

 "Granny Lupe!" Cat said. "Did you see the wolf?" Tarika asked. Granny Lupe shook her head. "I see two sneaky girls who should be in bed. Do you know how dangerous it is to be out alone?" Cat swallowed. "Do now." "Good." Granny Lupe smiled. "Always know exactly how dangerous something is. Then you can do it better." Her gaze flicked back toward the house as she sighed. "That man."

 The rattle of the old elevator's doors opening came from the front room. Then rubber wheels whirred across the tiles as her father sped up to the door. "Who's come!" he demanded, glaring at the street and the lawn and, finally, at Cat and Tarika.

 Cat lifted her shoulders in the smallest shrug possible.

 Tarika grinned and gave Cat's father a little happy wave. "Hi, Professor M. Um, early trick or treat?"

 "You two are supposed--" he began in fury. Then he looked hard at Granny Lupe.

 "I covered that. They're safe." Granny Lupe smiled at Cat. "You must expect a girl to take after her mother."

 "I expect nothing," Professor M snapped, whipping the wheels of his chair to face Cat. "What kind of fool are you? If something happened --" He clipped off the sentence before anyone could speak, before Cat could say what she was thinking: The kind of fool a fool like you would have!

 He inhaled deeply. "Kid, getting yourself into trouble is all on you. But dragging Tarika in--"

 "My bad," Tarika interrupted. "I thought it would be fun. I'm sorry."

 Professor M turned his gaze from Tarika to Cat like a sniper finding a target.

 "No, it wasn't!" Cat said, afraid Tarika would never be allowed to stay over again. "The bad was totally mine!"

 Professor M studied her for a long, long moment, then nodded. "Good theory, bad practice. If you both confess, you both get sentenced."

 He looked down at the silk-wrapped package on the porch, picked it up, and added, "Well. Another birthday. Same as it ever was."

 Cat said, "I know what I like." Granny Lupe said softly, "Sentenced? To what?" The two adults stared coldly at each other. Cat wondered who was more terrifying. Granny Lupe was tiny, no bigger than Cat, with a face as wrinkled as a shrunken head and hair the color of iron, but she stood as straight and moved as quickly as a ballerina. Her amber eyes saw things that anyone else would miss. Her Aztec features never showed fear. Nothing made her change her mind.

 But Cat had never seen fear on her father's Mediterranean features, and nothing made him change his mind either. His scars frightened small children who saw him. His skin was as dark as Granny Lupe's. His shoulders were broad and his arms were rippled with muscle. His black hair hung around his head in wild strands because haircuts were on his Life's too short for list. If he could have stood, he would have been at least a head taller than Granny Lupe.

 Cat had seen them stare often, like gunfighters under the noonday sun or martial artists in an arena. She knew the rules: the one who looked away too soon seemed weak; the one who stared too long seemed foolish.

 Cat said, "Can I get punished the day after my birthday?"

 They glanced at her simultaneously. Professor M snorted. "You don't even know what the punishment will be."

 "Duh! Cleaning my room! Sometimes I think you let me keep it a mess so you'll have a way to punish me."

 "Imagine how you could undercut that by keeping it tidy." Professor M closed his eyes, then opened them. "Doesn't giving you a favor cancel out your punishment?"

 "How about two punishments tomorrow for one favor today?"

 The professor looked at Granny Lupe. "You're right. Her mother's daughter."

 Tarika said, "I should help Cat." "Oh?"

 "We both confessed."

 Granny Lupe said, "Which was foolish. When there's no alternative, one sacrifices for the other. Then the survivor can avenge the fallen."

 Cat rolled her eyes. "Yes, Granny Lupe."

 The professor told Tarika, "Help her clean her room over the weekend." He held out the Halloween Fairy's package. "And box up the good china for mailing."

 "Mama's china?" He nodded. "Why?" "I sold it." "But--"

 "Two punishments was the deal." "You said you'd never sell that! You promised!" He inhaled deeply, then said, "We've got expenses." "Your stupid web site." "Including that." He waggled the silk-wrapped package. His ring, a silver snake wrapped around a turquoise stone, glinted in the twilight. She said, "You could sell your ring." "Some things can't be sold." Your things can't be sold. But you sell anything you don't care about, she thought, taking the package from his hand. He turned his stone-faced look away from her. "Since everyone's up,

 I'll start breakfast." Tarika said, "None for me, thanks. I have to get my books from home, so it'll be a peanut butter bolillo instead of your awesome pancakes."

 The professor gave her a small nod, then rolled toward the kitchen. When the door closed behind him, Granny Lupe whispered in a voice barely louder than a breeze, "Don't tell him about the wolf."

 Cat looked to see the hallway door closing. "Why not?" "Because you don't know what you'll win or lose by telling him." Tarika said, "It can't have been a wolf. Not in town. It must've been some kind of half-wolf." Granny Lupe smiled. "You are a good friend for Catalina." Cat smiled at Tarika. "Evil Dad's so easy to trick. Having you help makes it not-a-punishment. It makes it a double-treat with wonder sprinkles."

 Tarika said, "He might know that."

 Cat frowned. Seeing Granny Lupe do the same made her grin. Every time Cat thought she was the ugliest girl in middle school, she remembered that when she was old and being ugly didn't matter, she would look like Granny Lupe, only with her father's stupid brown eyes instead of Granny Lupe's beautiful amber ones.

 Beauty must skip generations, Cat thought, remembering the painting of her mother in her bedroom. Then she thought, So I'm fea. At least I get the awesomest costumes.

 As Cat yanked open the cords of her Halloween package, Tarika said, "Do you think that's a Halloween present or a birthday present?"

 Cat said, "Do you think I care?" "It could be a clue who sent it." "Very true, Nancy Drew." "Why try to catch someone who leaves presents?" Granny Lupe asked, "Better to catch those who don't and make them sorry." Cat said, "Because it's a mystery." Tarika nodded. "And we're spy girls." Cat flipped back the wrapping cloth to expose her latest costume.

 The silk wrapper held plain white cotton like a heavy sheet. Cat yanked it out, thinking it must be a second wrapping for her real costume, and it unrolled. It was a simple dress, floor-length, long-sleeved, boat-neck, boring. It came with white cotton slippers with hemp soles. There was no cape or jacket, no necklace or earrings, no tiara or crown. The usual card, in beautiful cursive script, said, Para la Princesa de la Sombra.

 Cat frowned at the dress. "That isn't something for a princess."

 Granny Lupe said, "You're a princess, no matter what you wear. Never forget it."

 Tarika said, "Maybe you're supposed to be a ghost." "Or the Bride of Frankenstein," Cat suggested. "If I had a wig." Granny Lupe said, "Princesses can wear simple clothes." "Why?" Cat asked. "What's the point of costumes that are more boring than your usual clothes?" Professor M, from the open kitchen door, called, "First pancakes are ready!" Then he added, "Kid, you don't have to wear that if you don't want to."

 Granny Lupe said, "Your father's even more foolish than usual this morning. Why spoil your birthday?"

 Cat squinted at the white dress. "The Halloween Fairy spoiled it."

 "You haven't tried it on," Tarika said. "Might look better than it looks like it looks."

 "You think so?" Tarika grinned and shook her head. "No. But I might be wrong." Granny Lupe said, "Your family will be disappointed if they don't see you in this year's costume." "The de la Sombra family or the Medianoche family?"

 "De la Sombra, of course," Granny Lupe said. "Whether your father's people--"

 Professor M said, "They like birthday pictures too."

 Cat asked Granny Lupe, "Tia Ysabel will be at the midnight party? Same as usual?"

 Granny Lupe grinned. "An army could not stop her."

 Cat asked her father. "And Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong are coming for dinner? Same as usual?"

 "You can depend on them." The professor glanced at Granny Lupe. "Always."

 "Well. Since it's for my families--" Cat looked back at the white dress. It wasn't a costume. It was a simple evening dress. It must mean she was becoming a woman. Maybe this birthday would be her best one ever.

 "I'll wear it," she told the professor. "But if I don't get a better costume next year, I'm trick-or-treating as Lady Godiva."

 As Granny Lupe clapped her hands and Tarika laughed, Professor M said, "Lady Godiva? Oh, right. She said she would ride through town wearing nothing but her hair, so her wise father locked her in her room until Halloween was over."

 Granny Lupe said, "The pancakes are about to burn." Professor M sniffed, spun his chair, and raced back into the kitchen. Cat said, "He's no fun." Granny Lupe nodded. "He's a Medianoche." Tarika said, "He makes great pancakes." "Like that forgives everything." Cat said. "Sometimes it does," Tarika agreed. "Maybe that's why Mama married him," Cat said, and giggled. "It's a great mystery," Granny Lupe said, looking into the house. Cat glanced at her. "With a simple answer," Granny Lupe added. "Temporary insanity." "They were in love," Cat said. "That's what I said." Tarika asked Granny Lupe, "You don't believe in love?" "Love of life, love of family, love of those who can't hurt you--"

 Granny Lupe smiled, showing her long, white teeth. "Love of sneaky girls who will soon be women, breaking many hearts. That's the kind of love I believe in."

 Tarika frowned. "I don't want to break any hearts."

 "Which will make people love you even more, and break even more hearts."

 "How many hearts did Mama break?" Cat asked.

 "One too few," Granny Lupe answered, and she went into the house. Seeing Tarika watching her, Cat said, "My family's too weird." "Whose isn't?" "Mine comes with extra weird sauce."

 "Yeah. But I like them." Cat blinked. "Even Evil Dad?" "There are eviler dads out there." "Having the almost-evilest dad in the universe isn't exactly comforting. Tee?" "What?"

 "If I could have you at the midnight party, I would. In a second." "I know, Cat. It's a family thing. I think it's the cool." "What? That Granny Lupe and Tia Ysabel like their private party?" "That they celebrate at the stroke of midnight, right when you were born. It's like a way to remember you and your mom at the same time." "I guess. And I get to dress up and play princess." Cat looked at the package with the white gown. "Which isn't going to happen this year.

 But otherwise, it'll be good." "That is some coincidence." Cat frowned at her. Tarika said "That you're named Medianoche and you were born at midnight." "Coincidences happen. Evil Dad says I'm the only Medianoche born at midnight he knows of. It prob'ly had to happen eventually." "The true." Tarika shrugged. "I should go get my books." "What about the wolf?" Tarika laughed. "Granny Lupe scared it so bad it's halfway to

 Nogales!" "Okay." Cat started to go inside, then whirled. "Don't forget your not-a-costume for school!" "No worries! The Halloween Fairy screwed up, but the not-a-costume will be the perfectest." As Tarika waved and walked away, Cat carried the white dress into

 Casa Medianoche's great room. She always waited until evening to put on her costumes, after dinner with the Medianoches and trick-or-treating with Tarika. She wouldn't let a boring costume change that.

 But the white gown had changed everything. Her home had always been the best place for make-believe. Now it was just an old house with shabby furniture, worn tile floors, dingy plaster walls, and dusty beamed ceilings. The paintings of her male Medianoche ancestors in military costumes seemed pitiful--there were knights, cavalry officers, ship's captains, and fighter pilots, but no generals or admirals. Granny Lupe once said you could see the history of Spain in the Medianoches: dark features from the Moors and glowering faces from centuries of war.

 The Halloween Fairy's costumes had been strange and old- fashioned, like Cat's home. But the white gown belonged to a place she could barely imagine, where everything was simple and modern and new, and the past never mattered.

 When she went into the kitchen, a plate of blueberry-pecan pancakes and a glass of milk were waiting on the table. Professor M had already gone to his study. Granny Lupe had returned to the basement. Cat sat and began to eat, thinking, These are the best pancakes ever. I would tell Evil Dad that. But he wouldn't care. 

 Chapter Two

 : Heartstopper

 As Cat passed her father's study., he looked up from a thick book and said, "Terrifying costume, kid."

 She wore a boy's black suit, a white shirt, a blue tie, and dark sunglasses, all from Goodwill. She nodded and almost kept walking. The memory of pancakes made her pause. "It's a not-a-costume."

 "Oh?"

 "Mr. Killjoy banned costumes at school. He says they're for children."

 "So you're not a bill collector? That's a relief." "I'm displaying my maturity by dressing like a productive citizen." "Because you're really a secret agent?" "I'm sorry." Cat reached into her pocket. "I must kill you now." She drew a water pistol, grinned, and aimed at him in a perfect two-handed grip.

 He threw his arms over his book. "Kid! If this got wet--"

 She felt her grin die. What could she say? That, for a moment, she had thought he was an ordinary father and she was an ordinary daughter, and they were having an ordinary moment of fun? She put the water gun back in her pocket. "I wouldn't have squirted you," she lied.

 He watched her as if he wanted to say something. He would never admit his books were more important than she was. She whirled and raced downstairs, shouting, "Bye, Granny Lupe!" so her father would hear that she didn't say goodbye to him.

 Granny Lupe called, "Let me see the not-a-costume!"

 Cat ran to the top of the basement stairs and turned like a runway model.

 From the shadows below, Granny Lupe said, "Ah. The best bad girls wear men's clothes. I remember a masque where Lucrezia Borgia--"

 "I'll be late! Tell me later!" Cat snatched her book bag and ran outside.

 The rising sun was just below the Rincon Mountains. Cat thought that if she could paint like Tarika, she would paint Luna Street with its small, southwestern houses in desert colors, burnt red, fire orange, and cactus green, all washed in soft blue light. She started toward the corner where she usually met Tarika. Someone was walking toward her. Her first thought: Tee had arrived early and was coming to meet her. But Tee was always late. Like Tarika, the stranger was slender. Alone on the street, he seemed tall. He walked with a lazy gracefulness like a dancer or a hunting beast. She thought, He's beautiful and terrifying and coming toward me. Look away!

 She flicked her gaze down. Don't be stupid. Older boys don't notice ninth-graders. At least, not geeky little ones with big noses. He must be looking at something behind me.

 On second glance, to her relief, he did not look beautiful or terrifying. He was lean and dark and handsome, but Tucson was filled with boys who were lean and dark and far handsomer. He wore a black denim jacket, faded blue jeans, black cowboy boots, and a loose white shirt. His face was narrow; his cheekbones, high; his nose, like a hawk's. He was taller than Cat, but he was not tall--everyone her age and older was taller than she was. His hair was in wild tufts, as if he had been running, but he walked like someone who never hurried. His eyes were the color of honey.

 When he showed his gleaming teeth in a smile, she thought, He's looking at me! And I look like some idiot kid who's staring at him!

 She turned her eyes away, desperately seeking anything that someone would naturally look at. Her cheeks burned. She wondered if he could see her blush.

 She had walked along Luna Street all her life. There was nothing special to stare at.

 If she kept looking sideways, she might bump into him. That would be the most embarrassing. She glanced ahead, expecting him to pass by without a glance.

 But he stood still in the middle of the sidewalk. His smile was wider. His teeth were as bright as a movie star's. He said, "Catalina." His voice was pleasant, with a hint of a Central or South American accent.

 She was gawking, she realized. She closed her mouth and told herself to walk on. But his cockiness annoyed her, and she was only afraid because he was handsome and confident, and once, when she made a list of the things she hated about herself, being too shy to talk to boys came right after her nose. She said, "If you're a perv, I'll scream and knee you in the cojones. I took karate."

 His grin grew wider. His golden eyes held her gaze. "Really?"

 Saying that she took three weeks of karate to be with her best friend, then dropped out because she was a klutz, would not impress anyone.

 "Really, karate. Not really scream first. The dad says knee first." The handsome boy laughed. "He would." She squinted in suspicion. "You know the dad?" "The professor would say we've met."

 She glanced up the street. No one was at the corner where Tarika usually waited. There was time to talk with a handsome stranger, though a voice in the back of her head whispered, Never talk to strangers.

 "Is that how you know my name?" "No." "If you knew the dad, you'd know no one calls me Catalina." She lifted her chin and brushed past him, thinking, Yeah, handled that well. When I tell Tee, she'll say I'm the awesome.

 His voice stopped her like a gentle hand on her shoulder. "Cat." She looked back. "Everyone calls you that," he said. "Except Granny Lupe, who calls you Little Terror when you amuse her and Little Miracle when you make her proud, and Professor M, who never says your name. Which is Catalina Milagros Medianoche. Today is your fourteenth birthday. You're old enough to marry, in some lands."

 Close mouth, knee perv, run. I wish he wasn't handsome. Cat said, "Who are you?"

 "Baldomero de la Sombra." "No way." He blinked, eyes large, mouth puzzled. "I don't lie. Not to you." "Cousin Baldomero has got to be way older than you." His annoying smile returned. "Why?" His hawk nose and amber eyes were like her mother's in the painting in her bedroom. She had studied that face every day, wondering what her life would have been like if she had grown up with two parents.

 "How come I never saw you?" "Did you ask the professor?" "He doesn't talk about Mama's family." "Or Granny Lupe?" "She says you're too busy with your foolishness." He laughed fondly. "I've missed her." She thought, A gorgeous cousin I never knew. The cool. Will Tee crush on him? Of course. I kind of am.

 She looked back toward Casa Medianoche. The faded red velvet drapes were drawn on the ground floor. Its flaking white plaster and the brown weeds in the front yard embarrassed her. She said, "Granny Lupe's probably asleep already." As his eyes narrowed, she added, "You know, 'cause of her porphyria. The sunlight."

 He looked toward the mountains. The sun was reaching the crest, casting a red glow in the morning haze. She thought, Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.

 He looked back at her. "You look like your mother, when she was young."

 She shook her head. "No way. Mama was beautiful." "Yes," he said simply. She thought, He's not saying I'm beautiful. He's saying Mama was beautiful. He's family. Family always say you look better than you do.

 He added, "A shame you have your father's eyes."

 She swallowed to hide a stab of disappointment, because he was right. Then he looked closer. "No. They suit you. They're black ice in his face, but in yours, they're the mystery and promise of night."

 He smelled like smoke and pine, something familiar and wild. His eyes seemed to glow like moonlight. She thought, Baldomero. I would do anything for you.

 He stepped back. "Someone's watching. A friend?"

 She shook her head to clear it, saw him frown, realized he had misunderstood, and nodded as she looked up the street. Tarika, in a man's dark suit and shades like Cat's, was approaching the far corner. "Tee. My best friend."

 Baldomero's frown slid easily into a smile. "You're gangsters?" Cat drew her squirt gun. "This is--" He caught her wrist before she could point it at him. His hand was cool on her skin and so firm that she couldn't move her arm, yet so gentle that she barely felt his grip. She finished, "--a stick-up?"

 He smiled, released her wrist, and spread his arms wide. "Forgive me. Should you wish to take anything else, I'm at your mercy."

 "Anything else?" "In addition to my heart." His smile made her think of a puppy. She laughed and squirted him in the eyes. He jumped back, shook water from himself like a dog, and said, "You don't believe me?"

 "'In addition to my heart?' Who would believe a line like that?"

 His eyes narrowed. "Huh. It must be harder to be convincing when I believe what I say."

 She squirted him again. "Yeah, right."

 He laughed, then looked at the sky, then back at her. "I must go. Don't tell anyone I spoiled the surprise."

 "What surprise?"

 "That I'm here. No one expects me until tonight, at your party. It'll be our secret?"

 "Our secret," she agreed. He nodded, turned, and began striding down Deseo Street. She heard Tee call, "Hola, La Gata! We'll be late!" Cat turned and began running down the block. On the far side of the street, Tarika was skipping between the curb and the sidewalk. Cat grinned. Last night, they had watched Singing in the Rain. Tarika was improvising a dance like Gene Kelly's.

 Reaching the curb, Cat glanced both ways. An orange van slowed as it approached the stop sign. She began to cross, calling, "Tee! That's perfect!"

 The loud caw of a raven made her look back. The orange van was speeding up as it shot through the intersection. Tarika screamed, "Cat!" The van was dusty and spattered with mud. The inside was dark.

 Someone sat behind the wheel in a blue jacket, white gloves, and a Donald Duck mask. Cat thought, He'll hit the brakes. There must be something wrong with the brakes.

 Should she jump back, run forward, or stand still and hope Donald swerved? She tried to see which way he would go. Then she saw the answer: Straight at her.

 Tarika shouted, "Run!" And Cat ran forward, knowing she could never be fast enough. Something slammed into the small of her back, throwing her into

 Tarika's arms. As Tarika jerked her onto the sidewalk, the van shot by. Cat spun to see what had happened.

 The white wolf was chasing the van. The van squealed around the next corner. Cat just had time to read the lettering on its side: Arkan Exterminators. No job too big or too small.

 The wolf followed the van around the corner, and both were gone. In the silence, Cat thought, A wolf saved me from Donald Duck. No. Donald couldn't have been aiming at me. He must've lost control of the van. Maybe he was having trouble seeing through his mask. It was an accident. A stupid accident. And a shaggy white dog bumped into me. Another accident. Nothing unusual. One bit of bad luck, one bit of good.

 It's perfectly ordinary.

 She began to tremble.

 Not a dog. A wolf. That looked just like the one that tried to steal my present. But there can't be wolves in Tucson. It must be a wild dog in the neighborhood, that's all.

 Tarika wrapped her arms around her and squeezed her hard. "Cat? You okay?"

 She nodded, though she wasn't. Everything around her seemed bright and fragile. She said, "Was that the same wolf?" "Or the same wolf-dog mix. We should call the police." "Because of the wolf-dogs?" "Because someone nearly killed you. That wolf-dog-whatever saved you." "Oh. Right."

 Tarika reached into her back pack, but Cat said, "I should," and got out her cell phone. As soon as the dispatcher answered, Cat said, "An orange van ran a stop sign and nearly hit me. It turned off De Anza onto Jeffords, heading downtown. The side says Arkan Exterminators. The driver's wearing a Donald Duck mask. He must be drunk or something. He didn't try to brake."

 The dispatcher said, "No one was hurt?"

 "No. A dog--" Cat stopped. What's stranger, nearly being run over or being saved by a wolf?

 "What about a dog?"

 "Nothing. It almost hit a dog, too. I'm okay, but that guy should be caught."

 "Don't worry, Miss. He should be easy to find."

 Cat gave her name, address, and phone number, thanked the dispatcher, and clicked off her cell. Tarika said, "Cat? You sure you're good?"

 She nodded for Tarika's sake, not because she believed it. "Good enough. Gooder, anyway. Where did the wolf-whatzit come from?"

 "Totally nowhere. Did you see its teeth? If it catches the van, that duck's dinner."

 "A wolf can't hurt a van."

 "If that one was after me, I wouldn't feel safe in a tank." Tarika hugged Cat again. "I'm just glad it likes you."

 "Totally ditto." Tarika released her and stepped back. "Cat?" "What?" "Remember me talking about the new boy in karate? The cute one?" "Not the cute one in your painting class?" "No." "Or the cute one in your dance class?" "Cat, this isn't about my infinite crushing. It's serious." "The tenth-grader? Ilya something?" Tarika nodded. "Ilya Arkan." Cat stared at her. "We should call the cops back." "You told them the name on the van. Let them handle it." "Right." As they started toward school, Cat said, "Could it have been

 Ilya?" "No way!"

 "Good." "I mean, it couldn't have been." "Because he's cute?" "And nice. And why would he wear a mask if he was driving a truck with his last name on it?" Tarika shook her head. "Too weird, Catgirl. Definitely let the police handle it. Hey, who were you talking to earlier?"

 "My cousin Baldomero. Now tell me he's the cutest boy ever." "Cute?" Tarika shrugged. "I didn't notice." "Wait. La Artista Who Notices All The Cute People didn't notice

 Baldomero?" "I just noticed you were talking to some guy." Her frown deepened.

 "I don't remember what he looked like. A really ordinary guy, right?" Cat laughed. "A really ordinary, absolutely gorgeous, kind of scary guy. I'm not the only one kind of shook up by that van." "Scary?"

 Cat said, "Like--" and stopped before she spoke the rest of her thought. Golden eyes.

 "Like what?" "This sounds crazy." "Like that'll surprise me." "Kind of like a wolf." Tarika stared at Cat while Cat thought, I sound like I've gone crazy.

 Maybe I have.

 Then Tarika smiled. "After this morning, you'll be seeing wolves all day. I hope they catch that dog soon."

 "Definitely ditto."

 *

 Because they arrived ten minutes late, Cat and Tarika were sent straight to the principal's office. Lovejoy, standing behind the front desk, towered over them, even over Tarika. He wore his usual dark suit, white shirt, and dark tie. He said, "Catalina Medianoche and Tarika Soto. It's always a pleasure to start my day with you two ladies. One week detention hall, starting today, for the Blues Sisters."

 Cat said, "Why?" "You know the costume policy." "Are you in a costume?" "Of course not."

 "Then we're not."

 "Hmm." He stroked his goatee. "Obviously you are, or you wouldn't have been sent here."

 Tarika said, "We were sent here because we were late." Lovejoy nodded. "Better and better. Two weeks detention." Tarika said, "Because Cat was nearly run over!" Lovejoy blinked at Cat. "Is this a joke?"

 Cat shook her head. "Call the police. We made a 9-1-1."

 Lovejoy said, "Wait here," and went in his office. After a minute, he came back and said gently, "Sorry. No detention. You may go back to class." He turned to the mirror and straightened his tie. "After all, can't blame you for wanting to look sharp."

 Cat said, "Sir? Did they find the driver?"

 "Just the van," Lovejoy replied. "A few blocks from where it was stolen. It must've been a kid on a joyride."

 Tarika said, "It was stolen?"

 Lovejoy nodded. "Which is not your problem now. Your problem is getting back to class while you still have my sympathy. That's good for another forty-five seconds." He glanced at his watch. "No, thirty-five. No, twenty-five--"

 Tarika tugged Cat's wrist. "We're gone."

 In the hallt, Cat smiled at Tarika. "I could turn cartwheels all the way to class."

 "Because we didn't get detention?" "Because the weird is over. Halloween can be normal now." "Maybe there should be some weird on Halloween." "Yeah. Predictable weird, like people in brilliant costumes, and surprise parties, and new kinds of candy in your trick or treat bag. Good weird. Not bad weird. "

 Tarika nodded. "Ilya will be glad they found his mom's van." "Wanting to forget about it, Tee." "Did I say he's cute?" "Did I say wanting to forget about it?"

 "Sorry, Cat. Really not so good at forgetting cute boys with Hungarian accents."

 Cat glanced at her. "Excuse me. What day is it?"

 Tarika nodded. "The true. And the very sorry. For the rest of the day, it's totally about you."

 Cat grinned. "You are Official Best Friend Ever." And before Tarika could say another word, Cat jerked open the door of their classroom.

 Trick Zapia looked up as they entered. Cat met his eyes, thinking,

 Yes, he's definitely the cutest boy in ninth grade, and maybe in school.

 She looked away without feeling the slightest bit embarrassed. Why had she thought he was so handsome? Why had she been afraid he would notice her? Even more importantly, why had she been hoping he would? He was just a cute boy in the ninth grade.

 He wasn't a young man with eyes like a wolf's. *

 At lunchtime, Cat carried her tray through the crowded cafeteria. Her path was blocked by a group of students, laughing together. She said, "'Scuse me." They turned to look at her. The group included Trick Zapia and his twin sister, Terese.

 Terese said, "It's the midnight girl! Did you hear your papi's web cast yet? Did you know there might be supernaturales among us?" She hugged herself and shuddered, making her friends laugh as she added, "Very scary, guapos y guapas!"

 Cat stared at her. "Not half as scary as you." Terese blinked. "Oh, the fraidy cat isn't running away as usual?" Cat thought, No way, and kept staring. Terese blinked again, then shuddered slightly, but this time no one laughed. Trick said, "More like a wildcat," and smiled. The mood changed instantly, and everyone laughed, but not like before. They weren't laughing at Cat. They were laughing with Trick.

 Cat told him, "I always thought you were nicer than your friends."

 Trick quirked his lips, a little puzzled, a little amused. "I try to be nice."

 "You'll make someone a good boyfriend someday. But not me."

 She turned and walked toward her usual table at the end of the room. Behind her, Terese muttered something about "una gata loca."

 Cat thought, Why am I so brave today? Maybe after nearly being eaten by a wolf and driven over by someone in a mask, school cliques seem totally unimportant.

 A boy in a faded jeans jacket was sitting at their usual table. Tarika was still at the counter, trying to decide which vegetarian option looked least disgusting. Cat scanned the room. There were no unoccupied tables.

 She inhaled deeply, then started forward. If she could face down the Zapia twins and their clique, she could face down some boy she'd never seen before. Things should be as they always were on Halloween, which included eating with Tarika at their usual table.

 She set her tray kitty-corner from him and said, "This table's reserved for ninth-grade losers."

 He shrugged. "I do not mind this." His accent was barely noticeable. His eyes were the color of milk chocolate. His hair was shaggy and reddish-brown. He had a wide jaw, a crooked nose, and a small scar by his left eye. Cat thought, He might've tried to kill me.

 The boy added, "I've been a ninth-grade loser. Being a tenth-grade loser is not as wonderful as I expected. But I'm sure that when I'm an eleventh-grade loser, that will be wonderful." He smiled, and Cat thought, Paranoid much, Cat Medianoche. The innocent until proven guilty, right?

 She said, "You're Ilya Arkan."

 He grinned wider than before. "Tenth-grade losers are famous in Tucson? In Budapest, we losers were, ah, anonny-moose?"

 "Anonymous," Cat said, deciding it was safe to smile back.

 "Anonymous," Ilya repeated. "I like this word. Anonymous. Also, incognito. It is mad cool. That I like, too. Mad cool. Why does English have so many rules when English-speakers love to ignore them?"

 "It gives English teachers something to do." "Yes," he agreed, nodding. "You're Cat Medianoche." "I am?" she said, then heard herself. "I mean, yeah. But how--" "Tarika Soto said her best friend was one of the two coolest chicas in

 Tucson." Tarika, arriving behind Cat, said, "I said Cat's my best friend ever." Ilya shrugged. "Which makes her one of the two coolest chicas in

 Tucson, yes?" "In Arizona." Tarika gave them both a smile as she sat by Cat. "You introduced yourselves?" Before Ilya could answer, Cat pointed at the soccer ball next to his backpack. "Shouldn't you sit with the jocks?" He squinted at her. "Must I sit with the same people always?" "It's one of the unwritten rules. But if you go back to the jocks and say two geeks sat down with you, you'll be forgiven." "You want me to go?" "For your own good." Cat thought, And so I won't have to wonder if you were driving the van that nearly ruined my birthday forever.

 Tarika said, "Your mom must be glad they found her van." Ilya blinked. "Our van was lost?" "Stolen. This morning." When his frown deepened, Tarika added,

 "Must've been after you left for school. The driver almost hit Cat." Ilya jerked his head to stare at Cat with something like fear or suspicion. "You saw this driver?" She shook her head. "He wore a Donald Duck mask." "Oh." Ilya looked away.

 A boy sitting with the soccer jocks saw his glance and called, "Hey, Arkan, what're you doing at the ooky-spooky table?"

 Cat said, "See how it works?" Ilya said, "Ooky and spooky?" "The dad has a web site about creepy stuff." "Ah." Ilya stood, grabbed his bag and tray, looked at the soccer jocks, then at Tarika, but not Cat. "Yes. I should go now." As he walked quickly away, Cat said, "Another victim of the unwritten rule. What a jerk." "Thought you wanted him to go." "Wanted to see if he'd crumble under peer pressure." Tarika nodded. "Maximum jerk. I heard some girl thought he was cute. Can you believe that?" "All kinds of crazy rumors go around school." Cat glanced back at

 Ilya. He passed the soccer jocks and went out, putting a phone to his ear. He was not part of a proper Halloween. Why wasn't she glad he was gone? 

 Chapter Three

 : Tricks and Treats

 When Cat got home, Casa Medianoche was quiet. Granny Lupe always napped in the afternoon, but Professor M was gone. So was his black van.

 What I should do, she thought, is start on my homework. Everything else can wait.

 She went to her computer. Homework can wait a minute.

 Googling "Arkan Exterminators Tucson" gave her an address and told her the business had just opened. The home page had a picture of Alexandra Arkan, a pretty, athletic woman in gray coveralls. Her hair was reddish brown, like Ilya's.

 Homework can wait half an hour. She bicycled the half-mile to Arkan Exterminators, planning ways to ask Ms. Arkan who might have stolen the van. The police couldn't say anything without proof, but Ms. Arkan might know. Or, at least, have strong suspicions.

 But as Cat was about to turn onto 22nd Street, she saw her father's black van parked in front of Arkan Exterminators. She blinked, telling herself there were many black vans in Tucson. But the license plate had the wheelchair symbol, and on the bumper was the sticker she gave him for his birthday: When you're out of coffee, I'm out of here.

 The van's side door began to open. Cat stomped on the pedals to shoot past 22nd Street. Had he seen her? She still wore the dark boy's suit, not her usual purple hoodie. The street was busy. He had no reason to notice a bicyclist half a block away when he was busy lowering his chair to the sidewalk.

 Why hadn't she ridden up and said, "Fancy meeting you here, stranger"? You're being silly, Cat. Ride back, say, "What a coincidence, Paternal Unit!" and put your suspicions to rest.

 The alley was a good place to turn around, so she swung into it. It was also the way to the back of Arkan Exterminators. She was only taking a short cut, she told herself, as she approached the parking area behind the orange cinderblock building.

 She could see light through the grill of the rear security door. The inner door was open. As Cat hesitated, straddling her bike and telling herself she shouldn't spy on her father, she heard a woman speak angrily in a language Cat didn't know. When the woman said, "Ilya!" as if she expected obedience, Cat knew who she was.

 A chime announced someone opening the front door. Cat heard rubber wheels rolling across linoleum. Ms. Arkan said something that must have meant "bye", then asked in a pleasant, husky voice, "How may I help--"

 When she fell silent, Cat rolled up to the door to peer inside. She saw shelves filled with cardboard boxes, but she could not see Ms. Arkan or her father.

 Then he spoke, so quietly Cat could barely hear him. "If it weren't you, Xandra--"

 "But it is me, Val. Don't speak of 'if.' There is what there is. It must be dealt with."

 "It's my concern." "You're still a fool! The danger--" "Is mine." "Is far more than that! Or have you come to think only you matter?" "I know what matters." His voice was so quiet and harsh that Cat was afraid for Ms. Arkan. If Ms. Arkan felt the same fear, she hid it with a laugh. "Ah, Val! Do not threaten me. Not now." "I can still do what I must. My arms might be stronger than before.

 On flat surfaces, I move faster. My mind--" "You're obsessed!" When he spoke, he sounded like the man Cat knew. "Not long ago, my daughter would've said, 'Takes one to know one.'" Cat could hear a sad smile in Ms. Arkan's voice. "My son also. We pay a high price for the lives we chose." "Yes."

 "I should not let you--" "You don't let, Alexandra. You stay out." "For now." "Until I've failed." "Then you'll let us--" "Then I won't be able to stop you." "Ah." Cat heard his wheels turning, then stop. He said, "Xandra?" "Yes, Val?" "You should've come to me." "Would anything have been different?" After a moment, he said softly, "No." The bell chimed as the door opened again. With the whisper of his wheels, he was gone.

 Ms. Arkan said several words Cat didn't know and was glad were not directed at her. She heard the click of a cell phone opening, and another burst of what must be Hungarian. It was quick, efficient, and almost emotionless, except when Ms. Arkan said "Valentin Medianoche."

 A raven's call made Cat look away. If she stayed, she would be caught by Ms. Arkan. The idea scared her. She felt as if her father's warning to stay out of this had been aimed as much at her as Ms. Arkan.

 But how could she stay out when she didn't know if she was in?

 She took the next street south of De Anza and pedaled as hard as she could, barely slowing to glance both ways at stop signs. Her father could do some things faster in a wheelchair than with two good legs, but getting in and out of the van wasn't one. On streets with many stop signs, Cat could ride faster than he could drive.

 At least, she hoped so. Her legs and lungs ached. The October afternoon felt too warm. She was afraid for her father, the man who had always made sure she had what she needed. She was afraid of her father, the man who spoke so coldly to Ms. Arkan. She was afraid for herself. Should she be watching for the return of the person in the Donald Duck mask? Or for something worse?

 She raced down Luna Street and braked hard beside Casa Medianoche. Her father's black van was rolling into the old carriage house.

 She waited until it was inside, then dragged her bike up the front steps, dropped it on the porch, ran through the house to the back stairs, and glanced out. Her father was rolling toward the side door.

 She ran down into the basement. Granny Lupe was lying perfectly still on her back on her narrow bed. The light from the TV flickered over her wrinkled face, etching deep shadows even deeper. Her chest barely moved.

 Cat touched her shoulder. Granny Lupe sat up, opening her mouth wide. Then she jerked back, saying, "Cat! I told you! Never wake me without warning!"

 "I should wake you to warn you I'm about to wake you?"

 Granny Lupe laughed. "Ah, my fury! Just don't come so quietly. Give an old woman time to prepare for a welcome visitor."

 "Sorry. Do you know anyone named Arkan?"

 Granny Lupe snarled in anger, then saw Cat's amazement and smiled. "Does that answer you?"

 "Ilya Arkan?" "No." For some reason, Cat was glad. Ilya was a jerk, but she didn't want him to be more than a jerk. "Alexandra Arkan?" "Is she dead?" "No."

 "A shame. Is she in Tucson?" Cat nodded. Granny Lupe hissed, then breathed deeply. "If I hadn't told your father I wouldn't swear in front of you, I would swear now." "I'll be fourteen. You can't shock me." "Fierce one, if I told you how I feel about Alexandra Arkan, I would shock you." "Why?"

 Granny Lupe looked upward. As Professor M's wheels came through the kitchen, he called, "Cat?"

 "Down here!" "Ah," he said and rolled away. Cat repeated, "Why do you hate Ms. Arkan?" "Because--" Granny Lupe waggled a finger at her. "You don't need to know everything. Not yet." "I need to know this." Granny Lupe stroked Cat's hair with cool fingers. "Well. That woman was competition for your father's heart." "I thought you didn't like Evil Dad. Wouldn't you have been happier if he had married her?" Granny Lupe put both hands on Cat's cheeks. "Then you wouldn't have been born. And I will grant this. He made your mother happy, for a time. The Arkan woman--" Granny Lupe shrugged. "Well. She tried everything to keep them apart."

 "Could she hate me because Mama won and she lost?"

 "Who cares what an Arkan thinks? I promise you, now that I know she's here, she won't trouble you for much longer."

 "Thanks, Granny Lupe." Cat glanced at the time on her cell and stood.

 "Where are you going?" "To get ready for dinner with Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong." Granny Lupe winced, then smiled. "Tell them I think of them often." "You could join us. I closed all the curtains." "No, my terror." Granny Lupe took Cat's chin in her hand and peered into her eyes. "Some things cannot be. It's not because I don't love you. And I'll give them this much. It's not because they don't love you."

 Cat shrugged. "It's cool. I get two birthday celebrations, dinner with them and a party with you and Tia Ysabel." She caught herself in time to keep from saying, And Cousin Baldomero. A secret should stay a secret. She liked knowing she and Baldomero shared something no one else knew. She added, "Next year, we could reverse that."

 Granny Lupe smiled. "The de la Sombras prefer parties to dinners." "Okay. See you after trick or treating." "You're old enough to prefer tricks to treats, you know." Cat sighed, "Yes, Granny."

 She ran up to the hall, then gasped in surprise. Her father was sitting by the front door. He said quietly, "Kid. Is there something you'd like to tell me?"

 Had he seen her at Ms. Arkan's building? As blood rushed to her cheeks, she realized she was assuming too much. "Did the police call you?"

 "Yes." "I was going to tell you, but I forgot." "You forgot you were nearly run over?" She shrugged. "It missed me. No biggie." He shook his head. "Kid, nearly getting hit by a car is a biggie." She wanted to throw her arms around him and say she was more afraid than she had ever been. She wanted to know that he would find the driver of the orange van and make her fear go away. She shrugged as if she didn't care and said, "I went to tell you when I got home. You were out."

 "Had to return some books to the library."

 She studied him. He could have been lying to her all his life. Shouldn't a daughter be able to know when her father lied?

 A car door slammed in the street. Professor M said, "That must be --"

 Cat turned and ran to the front door. Throwing it open, she called, "Uncle Olujimi! Auntie Fong!" and raced out to meet them.

 As a man in a white suit and a woman in a black one came from the taxi, Cat thought anyone could tell they were her father's family, even if they came from distant branches. So what if Uncle Olujimi was a stocky Yoruban who shaved his head and Auntie Fong was a tall Chinese with long white hair? Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong had the same dark brown eyes as her father, and Auntie Fong had the grim look that said any price is better than surrender.

 Like her father, Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong wore silver rings shaped like snakes wrapped around gems. Uncle Olujimi's was an onyx, and Auntie Fong's was a sapphire. The only time Cat ever saw Granny Lupe frown as if she was truly angry was when she looked at those rings.

 Cat threw her arms around Uncle Olujimi, and he pulled her into a big hug. "Hey, Tiger! How is it you get more gorgeous every year?"

 She grinned as she let go of him. "Best uncle ever!"

 Auntie Fong held out her hand. As Cat took it, Auntie Fong said, "You look well, child."

 "Thanks, Auntie."

 Professor M braked just behind Cat, then pushed against his armrests to stand, saying, "Olujimi, mi hermano!"

 They hugged, and Professor M added, "How are the Udofias?"

 Olujimi's grin grew wider. "My family is well, thank you. Dayo is expecting a child. How are the Medianoches, my brother?"

 Professor M said, "The ones in Tucson are glad you're here. Last I heard, the Spaniards are still doing the same old things in the same old ways."

 "People like tradition," Auntie Fong said, nodding to him. "It binds us."

 "That's the word I'd use," said Professor M. "How are the Fongs?"

 Auntie Fong narrowed her eyes at him. "Have you heard of any trouble in our part of the world?"

 "No." "Then you know." "Excuse me," said Cat, looking at the shopping bags that Olujimi held. "It's Selfish Birthday Girl Day, and that looks like--" "Dinner from Maya Quetzal!" said Olujimi. "Pupusas, chips and salsa, chile rostizado, chile relleno, borracho beans, rice, fresh corn tortillas, quesadilla with mangoes--" He sighed. "I have missed this country." Cat looked at the bag in Auntie Fong's hand. "That doesn't look like food." Auntie Fong said, "No." "I'm the luckiest girl ever," Cat said, thinking, This is how

 Halloween is supposed to be.

 "I hope you are," said Auntie Fong.

 When they went inside, to everyone's surprise, Granny Lupe was waiting in the shadows of the parlor. She looked at the shopping bags, sniffed, and said, "As if I would poison the lot of you."

 Everyone was quiet for a second. Then Auntie Fong began to laugh, and the rest joined in, except for Professor M.

 Cat asked Granny Lupe, "You'll eat with us after all?"

 "No." She smiled at Auntie Fong. "I just didn't want anyone to think I was hiding from them."

 "We have no illusions about you," Auntie Fong replied, and held out her bag to Cat. "You might as well open this now." Cat yanked wrapping paper off the top of the bag, then pulled out a pair of roller skates. "Purple! The perfect!" With a glance at Granny Lupe, Auntie Fong said, "Just something to get you out in the sun more." Granny Lupe said, "A quiet way to travel is especially useful at night." Olujimi, looking at the two old women, said, "Some things never change." He grinned at Cat. "There might be something in my pockets for you." And then he did his usual trick of reaching into different pockets of his clothes and handing Cat something from each. This time, he had a dream catcher from an Ojibwe tribe in Canada, a small bronze statue of an elephant-headed god from India, a porcelain Buddha from China, and a silver cross on a necklace from Italy. Each gift made Granny Lupe smile, except for the cross, which made her laugh.

 Granny Lupe left them before dinner. Professor M never seemed quite as evil when Olujimi was around. The professor was still quiet, and his face was still grim, but when Olujimi laughed, Professor M would rock back in his chair slightly and nod as if he was laughing too.

 As Cat was finishing dinner, her cell vibrated. She checked the screen: "TRICKORTREAT?"

 She tapped "Y <3" and said, "Gotta go. Tee's expecting me. I'm glad you could come."

 Auntie Fong said, "We had business with your father anyway." Olujimi said, "Which means, we're very glad we could come, too." Cat hugged him, shook hands with Auntie Fong, nodded to Professor M, and started for the front door. In the hall, when the professor rolled up behind her, she looked back in surprise.

 He said, "Kid, be careful out there."

 "I know. Run and scream, and if someone tries to force me anywhere, fight them. In that order." She pulled the front door open. "Don't worry. I've got my cell."

 "It's charged?" As she glanced back at him, he said, "Stupid father question. You're a teen. Of course your cell phone's charged. One more thing."

 "What?" she said, barely keeping the exasperation from her voice.

 He turned his head in the expression that, if she had not known how humorless and self-absorbed he was, she might have mistaken for a smile. "Have fun."

 "I will," she said, and ran out, determined that no matter what happened, she would make that come true.

 *

 Tarika's house was like most houses in Tucson's Barrio del Rio: small, stuccoed, with a red tile roof, burnt orange walls, and purple trim around the doors and windows. When Cat rang the bell, a tall skeleton in a dark suit opened the front door and said, "You're late."

 "Like that's different." The skeleton said, "On Halloween." "Uncle Olujimi kept telling funny stories about his kids and wives.

 He's so nice he likes Evil Dad. Also, something happened." "No talk." Tarika yanked Cat inside. "The maestro must work." "But I've got to tell you about this afternoon!" "Which is why I'll do your hands first." Tarika dragged Cat to her room, a mash-up of Mexico and Africa.

 Against one wall were an acoustic guitar, a keyboard, a doumbek, and a hammered dulcimer. One corner of the room was bare so Tarika could dance. One wall had a mural she had painted of her heroes. Muhammad rode a flying horse through the night sky, Jesus walked above a lake during a storm, and Shakira danced in space with the earth, the moon, and the sun behind her. Below the mural was lettered in gold paint, You are a song written by the hands of God.

 Cat dropped onto a big pillow on the floor. While Tarika painted finger bones on her skin, Cat told everything she had seen and heard about her trip to Arkan Exterminators. When she finished, she asked, "What do you think?"

 "I'm with Granny Lupe. Ms. Arkan's a stalker ex-girlfriend." "And someone stole her van and nearly hit me? Big coincidence." Tarika shrugged. "If there weren't coincidences, there wouldn't be a word for them. Is Ms. Arkan dumb enough to run someone over in a car with her name on the side?"

 "Maybe someone wanted to frame her."

 "You think your dad could have two stalker girlfriends? Someone reads too much manga."

 "Would a stalker show up after fourteen years?" "Why not? Your dad's the hot." "The hot? Evil Dad?" "Totally Heathcliffy."

 Cat frowned. "He's like a cartoon cat?" "He's like the guy in Wuthering Heights. I would so stalk him." "La, la, la!" Cat stuck her fingers in her ears. "I'm not creeped out." Tarika pulled Cat's wrists down. "If I was old and into Heathcliffs, which I'm not. I want a boy who can laugh, like Trick or Ilya." As she began painting Cat's face, Tarika added, "You ever see any of the old Professor Midnight videos? From before you were born?"

 "No. Like the new ones aren't embarrassing enough."

 "He wasn't Heathcliffy then. He joked around. Like he knew his show was silly, but he didn't care, because he loved sharing what he knew about monsters and all. I'll bet he was one of those guys who could've been with any straight girl or gay boy he wanted, only he was too clueless to know it."

 "Not doubting the clueless." Tarika set down the makeup. "You're awful hard on him." "How often does your mom tell you she loves you?" "Um, every day? At least." "Evil Dad never said he loved me." "Cat, he takes great care of you." "That's 'cause he's got an ego thing about being responsible. I think

 I was an accident, so he feels obliged to pay for it." "That's more than some fathers do." "Yeah. I don't call him Evilest Dad, do I?" Cat nodded at the makeup. "Who's wasting time now?" Tarika resumed painting Cat's face. "Why don't you think Ms.

 Arkan's just a stalker girlfriend?" "'Cause they were talking about danger. About his arms being strong." "Don't be shocked, girl. Sounds like sex talk." "No way! He's not interested." "You're like evidence to the contrary." "But he hasn't gone out with anyone since Mom died." "Doesn't mean he's not interested." "He's crippled!" "Just because he can't walk doesn't mean he can't--" "No. If you'd heard, you'd know. It was about something dangerous." "Okay. Let's say the van wasn't an accident. Maybe your dad and

 Ms. Arkan were international spies, and the Russian mob is trying to get revenge on them by killing you and framing her."

 Cat laughed. "I'm not the only one who reads too much manga."

 "But if I'm right, someone might try to kill Ilya and frame your dad now."

 Cat shook her head. "I don't think it's spies." "So ask your dad about it." "I did. He lied." "Your dad? He never lies!"

 "He said he was at the library. Maybe he lies all the time, and I never caught him before."

 "Maybe he had a good reason, like it's something private that doesn't affect you. I say stop worrying and start trick-or-treating."

 "Easier said than done." Tarika held up a mirror. "Say you can't." Cat stared at herself in delight. The second skeleton was ready for

 Halloween. They grabbed hats, a jazz musician's porkpie for Cat and a black- and-silver mariachi sombrero for Tarika. As Cat picked up the karaoke machine, Tarika said, "Maybe this isn't the best idea after all."

 Cat said, "What's the second rule?" "I'm not wimping out! I'm just not sure I'm ready--" "And when would you be sure?" Tarika swallowed, then nodded. "At least no one'll know who we are in our make-up." "No, not at all," Cat said. "We could be any two kids in the barrio.

 Who look like ninth-grade girls. One short, one tall." Tarika sighed. "Whose stupid idea was this?" "Yours," Cat said, laughing, as she hauled Tarika through the house. As soon as they stepped outside, Tarika relaxed and Cat started looking for orange vans, white wolves, and strange people. Then she smiled. Pirates, zombies, and superheroes were walking along De Anza Street. Strange is the point of Halloween.

 Cat said softly, "No wimp outs." Tarika glanced at her. "Heard it the first time, Cat." "Saying it for me, Tee." "Oh," Tarika said, and then, "Oh! Are you still shook--" "Way no!" Cat said loudly to convince both herself and Tarika.

 "Let's do it." She marched toward the neighbors' home. Tarika said, "Can I half-wimp?" "It's the Sanchezes." Cat set down the karaoke player and rang the door bell. "They'll love it, even if it's all fail." "We could just get candy and go." Cat punched play. "Too late." For the next two hours, they raced from house to house performing

 Halloween carols: "Monster Mash," "Thriller," "Ghost Riders in the Sky," "Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner," "Jumbie Jamboree," and "I Put A Spell On You." Tarika sang lead, Cat sang back-up, and they danced to their own choreography. When they were exhausted and their bags were stuffed full of candy, they staggered back to Tarika's house, where Mrs. Soto insisted they perform all the songs again. When they dropped Cat off at home afterward, she told Tarika, "Best. Halloween. Ever!"

 But she knew the best was yet to come. 

 Chapter Four

 : Midnight Girl

 The only thing better than trick-or-treating was coming home to the front path lit by candles in tin luminarias, a jack o'lantern glowing by the door, and Professor M and Granny Lupe sitting on the porch. Under the yellow porch light, Granny Lupe rocked in her chair, snapping her fingers to the beat of whatever was playing through her earbuds. Professor M, reading a book, sat near her with a blanket over his legs. Cat laughed--this was how every trick or treating was supposed to end.

 Which made her think of Baldomero. He had never been part of her Halloween. But she did not mind changes that made Halloween even better.

 Granny Lupe grinned at Cat and took the buds from her ears. "Have a good time, my terror?"

 Cat shook her head. "Who should I punish?" Cat laughed. "I had a great time." Granny Lupe nodded. "You are truly--" "Yourself," Professor M finished. "Yes," Granny Lupe agreed. "You should get ready for your midnight party." "I can't be skeleton girl?" Granny Lupe smiled and shook her head. "How often does Ysabel get to see you? Be beautiful for her." "Skeleton girl is beautiful." "You don't have to hide yourself, my fierce one. You're beautiful exactly as you are." "I wish I looked like Tarika." Professor M said, "Tarika's got that covered. Look like you, and you'll be fine." "Yeah, right." Cat headed inside, thinking that in father-talk, "fine" meant "hopelessly weird." Granny Lupe said, "I'll start hot chocolate." "With cinnamon?" Granny Lupe lifted her chin high and stared at Cat. "We are a proud family of a noble lineage! Of course, with cinnamon!"

 Professor M said, "I'll light the fire." Cat said, "S'mores?" Professor M nodded. "It is your birthday." "I wish Tarika could come over."

 Granny Lupe said, "We de la Sombras are jealous of our good luck." "Tarika could have hot chocolate and s'mores before Ysabel comes." Professor M glanced at Granny Lupe. "Maybe next year." Granny Lupe shrugged. "Who can know?"

 Professor M rolled down the ramp and went from luminaria to luminaria, blowing each one out. Cat asked, "Can't we let them burn?"

 Granny Lupe shook her head. "Ysabel doesn't need the light. Or want it."

 In her bedroom, scrubbing away makeup, Cat thought about the Halloween Fairy's gift. A white dress and slippers were so meh after all the birthday costumes she had known. But she was fourteen now. White meant innocence. Maybe the costumes would become more mature with each birthday after this: pink for fifteen, red for sixteen, crimson for seventeen, black for eighteen. Or maybe white didn't mean a thing. Maybe whoever brought the costumes simply thought a change would be nice.

 What would Baldomero think?

 She put on the dress, wondering if the right clothes would transform her from a big-nosed, flat-chested girl to a gorgeous young woman who looked like her mother. When she looked in the mirror, she thought, Chica, you're just funny-looking. Accept it.

 She saw a girl dressing up like a woman. She turned from side to side, but she could not make herself look like Mama. She studied the painting over her bed. She could see a resemblance, but it was like a sculptor's apprentice had taken all the same pieces and put them together slightly off.

 Baldomero was lying or crazy. She hoped for crazy. She wished Tarika was there to do her hair and makeup. If she tried to do anything more than comb her hair, she would look like a clown or a zombie.

 She shivered. Whoever chose her costume had forgotten Tucson nights could be cold by the end of October. She closed her bedroom window, then thought, If you have to look like a funny-looking girl, look like a comfortable funny-looking girl.

 She pulled on striped black-and-purple leggings and her purple hoodie. That made the white slippers look odd, so she changed them for her low purple boots, then checked in the mirror.

 Her father was right. Since she couldn't be Tarika or anyone else, she should be herself.

 When she came into the parlor, the fire was blazing. Professor M glanced at her and nodded. Granny Lupe's eyes narrowed. She said, "That's--"

 Professor M said, "Yes?"

 Granny Lupe shook her head. "Different. Which proves she's the daughter of Zoraida de la Sombra."

 Professor M winced as usual at her mother's name. Cat asked Granny Lupe, "Have you been drinking sherry again?"

 Granny Lupe laughed. "It's a wonderful night. I had a taste." Professor M said, "Four tastes." Granny Lupe whirled toward him. "You'd be better company if--"

 Then she smiled. "No. You would sink from glum to maudlin. Stay sober."

 Professor M shrugged and poked at the logs in the fireplace. "It's my birthday," Cat said. "You two have to play nice." Professor M turned his head like a hawk, and Cat thought of the things that had happened during the day. She opened her mouth to ask about Ms. Arkan, but before she could, Granny Lupe said, "Hot chocolate's ready. Help carry."

 And Cat decided that anything unpleasant could wait one more day.

 For the next hour, they drank hot chocolate and toasted s'mores. They played Chinese checkers, and Cat won every game. She was bouncing a marble across the board in victory when the hall light flickered, and she turned.

 A slender woman in a red coat, tank top, capris, and sandals smiled at her from the parlor doorway. Her skin was brown and her eyes were amber, like Baldomero's and Granny Lupe's. Her hair was the color of copper. The bones of her face were strong and beautiful, so much like the painting of Cat's mother that, for an instant, she thought she was looking at her mother. Then she said, "Tia Ysabel!"

 "Yes! La Ysabel esta aqui! Lessez les bon temps rouler!" Ysabel held up a tiny purple MP3 player and asked Professor M, "You don't mind, Herr Professor?" Before he could answer, she plugged it into the parlor's sound system. As a Brazilian pop song began to play, Ysabel tapped her foot and held out her hand to Cat. "We are the stars, Darling Miracle!"

 They danced around the parlor with Cat following Ysabel's moves as best she could. When Granny Lupe began clapping time, Cat cried, "You, too!" and offered her hand.

 Granny Lupe grimaced, saying, "I'm too old for this nonsense," then began dancing as gracefully as Ysabel. Cat wished they could dance forever. How would it be better? If Tarika was there to dance with them?

 No. If Baldomero was. As the next song began, Ysabel grabbed Professor M's wheelchair to spin him. A glance at his face made her let go. For once, Ysabel did not laugh, though she smiled as she returned to dance with Cat and Granny Lupe.

 The sound of an approaching motorcycle cut through the music. Professor M looked at Granny Lupe. "You didn't say there would be more."

 Granny Lupe said, "We de la Sombras do not care to be predictable." "I'll get it!" Cat cried as she raced to the front door and flung it wide. In the middle of the yard, a slender young man in a black helmet, gray leather jeans and a matching jacket, a white silk shirt, and dark gray boots was setting a large black motorcycle on its kickstand. When he pulled off his helmet, she saw Baldomero grinning at her. Dropping the helmet onto his seat, he ran toward her, leaped onto the porch, and bowed low. In the shade of the night, he was more handsome than she remembered.

 "Command me, your highness!" he said with a smile that was half- mocking and half-sincere. "I, Baldomero de la Sombra, your cousin and champion, will seek your heart's desire, wherever it lies, whatever its cost."

 She opened her mouth to laugh, but instead said quietly, "Perhaps I shall."

 He smiled up at her. "I never make light promises." Then, rising, he frowned. "You modified your costume. You didn't like it?"

 "You're the Halloween Fairy?" "Me, a fairy?" He laughed. "Yes. Your fairy. I hoped to delight you." "I loved the others. This one..." She shrugged. "The others were for you to hide in. This one's to bring out your true self. I should've known that meant you would change it." His smile grew wider. "Your father must be driving off boys with a stick."

 Could he see her cheeks grow warm? She shook her head, too flustered to answer.

 From the hall, Professor M said, "I was planning to start tonight." Baldomero laughed. "Ah, Professor! You have the wit!" Professor M said, "I'd rather have the stick. You come unannounced." "It's our way." He looked at Cat. "Do you mind?" "Of course not!" "Then I'm welcome?" "Always!" She hesitated, then thought, He's family! It's okay! She threw herself into his arms to hug him. He felt cold from his ride, and firm and lean. It was like embracing a stallion made of ice. Rocking back from the impact, Baldomero laughed. "Ah, I believe I am!" Professor M said, a bit louder than he may have needed to, "Since you've been welcomed, let's go in." In the parlor, Granny Lupe was setting a large purple cake on a table by the fireplace. Cat wanted to ask why it wasn't strawberry as usual, but she felt torn: Change bad, purple good.

 Ysabel stood and beamed at Baldomero. "My son. Where did I see you last? Prague? Johannesburg?"

 "Stockholm, Mother Dear." He kissed Ysabel, then said, "Or Reykjavik? Someplace cold where we fed well, anyway."

 Cat studied them. Ysabel looked exactly as she remembered, yet Ysabel could have passed for Baldomero's sister. Was that plastic surgery, or did the de la Sombras age very gracefully?

 Ysabel caught her look. "Forgot to say. Love the costume. Best yet!"

 Cat nodded and glanced at Professor M and Granny Lupe. If she had not seen them for a year, would she think they looked younger?

 No. Granny Lupe, in her loose black cotton dress and a black lace shawl, looked exactly like herself: tiny, wrinkled, gray-haired. Who could tell if more wrinkles had been added in a year? None had been taken away.

 But, with a shock that she hid, Cat saw her father looked weaker. His hair and beard were flecked with gray. His scarred face was leaner than she remembered. His eyes were sunken, sleepless and haunted. The green wool blanket covering his legs and lap made him look frail. Until tonight, he had only worn blankets when he went outside in very cold weather.

 Granny Lupe laughed as she took Baldomero's face in both hands, kissed him loudly on each cheek, and said, "It gladdens this old woman's heart to see you as handsome as ever!"

 Professor M said, "He'd look better if he worked on his tan." "No way," Cat said. "He's perfect." Baldomero shook his head. "I'm not so vain I need flattery. Tell me, my princess, how has your birthday been?" Cat said casually, "Well, a van almost hit me this morning." "A van owned," Granny Lupe added, "by Alexandra Arkan." "No!" Ysabel hugged Cat so tightly that Cat thought, Like hugging a panther. Ysabel, frowning at Granny Lupe, said, "We should--" "Cat's fine," Professor M said. "And it's her birthday. Focus on enjoying that now." "Wise words, Herr Professor!" Ysabel unplugged the purple music player and put it in Cat's hand. "Your present, Miracle. It was black, but I knew that would never do, so I painted it."

 Baldomero slapped his forehead. "I haven't given you your present yet!" He drew a slender chain from his jacket. A heart-shaped locket dangled from it. Cat didn't dare speak as he set the cold silver in her hands.

 He said, "You don't like it?" "It's the most beautiful thing ever." His smile grew wider. "You can open it." She found the clasp. The heart sprang apart. Inside were two tiny paintings. One was Baldomero with long white hair tied back in a queue. The other was her mother with white hair in ornate curls.

 Ysabel looked at the portraits, "Powdered hair was such a pain."

 Baldomero glanced at Granny Lupe. "It suited Zoraida." He turned to Cat. "Throw away the one of me, if you want. I couldn't find one of Ysabel or Lupe that fit--"

 Cat said, "No throwing away is happening," then looked at Ysabel and Granny Lupe. "Now I need something for pictures of you two."

 Ysabel kissed her forehead. "Never change, dear Catalina." Granny Lupe said, "No. Change well." Professor M said, so softly that Cat barely heard him, "Ditto." As Cat settled the necklace over her dress, Baldomero asked, "What are you now, Catalina?" She smiled smugly. "Me." He glanced at Granny Lupe, who looked away. Cat wondered if she had said something wrong as he looked back at her. His eyes were like the sky on a stormy night. "You're la princesa de la sombra."

 Cat smiled. "I'm kind of old to pretend I'm a princess."

 He shook his head. "Never, Catalina. First you pretend, then you become." As she frowned, he smiled. "If that amuses you. Doing what amuses you is the most important part of being a princess."

 She laughed. "Okay, for tonight, definitely princesa de la sombra."

 Professor M exhaled, a tired sound. He had folded his arms under the blanket. Cat wanted to ask if he was cold, but he would never admit to a weakness where people could hear. No, he would never admit to a weakness where Cat could hear. Realizing that made her want to hug him, but she couldn't think of an excuse that wouldn't make her look childish or make her father look weak in Baldomero's eyes. She thought, Maybe Tee's right. Maybe I've been too hard on him.

 Professor M saw her glance. "Happy birthday, kid."

 Baldomero looked at the tall clock by the door to the hall. "You're early."

 "I do what I must when I want to be first." Professor M drew his hands out of his blanket. "Birthday hug?"

 "Birthday hug," Cat agreed. Wondering if he had also been tasting Granny Lupe's sherry, she put her arms around him and squeezed. He smelled like peppermint soap and wool and something garlic from dinner. He might look frail, but his shoulders felt strong. He felt like Dad.

 Baldomero said, "Ah! Nothing's finer than a family's love."

 Professor M let go of Cat, put his hands back under the blanket, and looked at the clock. "Nearly midnight."

 Baldomero turned to Ysabel. "You brought something to toast the birthday girl?"

 Ysabel reached into her long coat, drew out a murky bottle of wine, and showed the faded label to Professor M. "If you agree."

 He squinted at it. "Was that a good century?" Baldomero grinned. "For our miracle? You may be sure, Professor." Professor M told Cat, "Your call, birthday girl." She wanted to know what he wanted her to do, but his expression never changed. She looked at Baldomero, Ysabel, and Granny Lupe, and saw how hopefully they smiled. Cat said, "I'd like that."

 Professor M shrugged, or maybe he shivered. Cat heard the cork pop and looked at the bottle in Ysabel's hand.

 Granny Lupe took wineglasses from the table and held one out. The wine was so dark that Cat saw it as black, not red. It smelled of something she didn't know, something that must be grapes and iron and the minerals of the earth.

 The first glass was only a quarter full when Granny Lupe offered it to Professor M. Baldomero said, "Father of all our hope, will you do us this honor?"

 The professor looked at Cat, then held out his left hand, took the glass, swirled it, sniffed it, and drained it in a swallow. He sat still while everyone watched. After a long moment, he nodded. "I've had worse."

 Granny Lupe laughed and filled the glasses. Cat studied hers. "What if I don't like it?"

 Baldomero said, "Then we'll know you're not your mother's daughter. And since I know you are--"

 The clock struck.

 Professor M's head snapped toward it, then toward Cat. The de la Sombras smiled as if they were at a comedy, but Professor M was watching a different show. As the clock counted twelve, Cat felt happier for herself and sadder for her father. Books and movies told her what he must be feeling. His girl was becoming a woman. Soon she would be gone, and he would be alone in Casa Medianoche. As the bells continued to ring, she thought, First chance I get, I promise him he'll never lose me.

 The twelfth stroke of midnight hung in the air, then died. In that instant of silence, Cat heard her father sigh in relief. She thought, I'm totally fourteen. Whatever that means.

 Baldomero raised his glass. "Let's each toast our princess and drink. As the one toasted, Catalina, you have to sit there and be embarrassed until we're done. Then you may speak what's in your heart and drink." He nodded, almost bowing, then hesitated, prolonging the moment that his and Cat's eyes met. She was so content that when he spoke, his voice surprised her. "To Catalina Milagros Medianoche, the hope of all de la Sombras." He drank, then turned to Granny Lupe.

 Granny Lupe said, "To my fierce Catalina, a great terror and a greater delight. May many lovers suffer great torment for you, and may all your foes know the full extent of their error." She drank, then looked at Ysabel.

 Ysabel said, "To La Bella Catalina. Dance through ten million nights." She drank, then looked back at Baldomero.

 He said, "And now--" "My turn," said Professor M. Baldomero blinked, then said, "Of course." Professor M raised his glass. "To Cat. Always trust yourself. And know that all I've done since I first held you was for you. That'll always be the greatest privilege of my life."

 Cat felt tears gathering in her eyes. "Dad--" Baldomero said, "Make it a toast!" Cat held up her glass. "To my family, the best in the universe. And my dad who, well, who was always there when I needed him, and who, uh, should know that I'll always be there if he needs me."

 She thought she saw tears in Professor M's eyes. She wanted to hug him, and she might have, but Baldomero said, "Now drink!"

 With a sheepish smile, Cat raised the glass to the de la Sombras, then to her father, then drank.

 The wine passing her lips was sour. She wanted to spit it out, but how could she do that in the parlor?

 The taste changed on her tongue. Not sour. Bitter? No. Tart. Deliciously tart. She had not realized how thirsty she was. She tipped the glass back, taking it all in one long, delightful drink. She felt it dribbling from the corners of her lips, but why would anyone want to stop drinking until it was gone?

 As the last drops slid into her mouth, Baldomero said, "Your clock is fast, Professor. This is midnight." Cat dropped the glass and heard it shatter. She didn't care about a glass. She cared about wine. The front of her mouth tingled deliciously. She smiled, licked her lips for a last taste, and looked around for more to drink.

 The de la Sombras smiled at her, just as they had when the clock first struck.

 Her father stared at her in horror.

 The room swayed and darkened. Cat reeled, but a strong hand caught her. Baldomero said, "Easy, your highness."

 Cat straightened up, feeling awake and strong and wonderful. She had never noticed how every subtle scent and sound told a story. She had never noticed how sharp her teeth were.

 Someone in the room was afraid. Someone in the room was moving a cloth made of wool.

 She turned and said, "Dad?"

 He was lifting something long and gray from under his blanket, a pistol like a flare gun that made a sound like a balloon exploding. A long, pointed bolt of wood shot from it.

 Toward her heart. 

 Chapter Five

 : The End of the Party

 Two Cats saw death coming. One stared in confusion as her father shot something at her. The other marveled at the bright beauty of the first and last moment of her life: The wooden bolt, as long as her forearm, as thick as her wrist, its barbed head, its flared fins. The professor's grim scowl. Baldomero's surprise. Granny Lupe's fear. Ysabel's confusion. Dust motes shimmering in the electric light. The peppermint and salt smell of the professor's soap and sweat. The slight, tart scent of the de la Sombras. The tang of garlic wreaths in the upstairs hall. The cool, dry touch of the night air. The cobweb-light embrace of her Halloween dress. The comforting warmth of her hoodie.

 The first Cat thought, Not happening! Can't be happening.

 The second Cat thought, Stupid old self, I should snuff you now so I'll be perfect when I die. No. Let Evil Dad kill you along with me. The death of the old Cat will be his price for killing the new one.

 As the sharp tip of the bolt touched her chest, a slender hand caught it by the shaft. Both Cats gasped in surprise. Granny Lupe, grimacing, held the bolt firm. Its tail fins raised dots of blood at the heel of her hand. She whirled and flung the bolt at the professor, as fast as he had fired it.

 The first Cat shouted, "No!" Did she mean for Granny Lupe to stop or for none of this to happen?

 The second Cat kept silent. The professor was a lone human. Her true family could deal with him.

 Professor M dropped the pistol and pressed his armrest. His chair shot backward several feet, and the bolt whistled past his shoulder.

 The first Cat thought, Thank God!

 The second thought, He never told me what his chair could do. What else did he hide?

 Ysabel leaped across the parlor, her hands curved like claws, her mouth wide in fury. Professor M yanked his arm rests. Two thick arrows like crossbow quarrels shot from the chair. One pierced Ysabel's hip, and she fell. The other flew at Cat's waist.

 The quarrel slowed as she watched it come. The air grew thicker. The first Cat knew no one was near enough to save her. The second remembered how Granny Lupe had caught the bolt.

 Cat twisted sideways. The quarrel tore through the front of her hoodie, hit the parlor's wainscoting, and stuck, vibrating in slow motion. The first Cat wanted to scream and hide. The second wanted to attack the threat to her life.

 Granny Lupe caught Cat's arm in her strong hand and shoved her behind her, saying, "Stay safe!" But Cat leaned out to watch Baldomero charge the professor. Both Cats needed to know what would happen, and what she should do, and what she was now.

 Her father crossed his arms overhead to grip the back of his wheelchair. As he brought his hands down, two slender swords whisked from the chair's frame. One plunged into Baldomero's chest.

 Before Cat could cry out, she saw two impossible things. Though Baldomero was pierced by the sword, he leaned into her father's blade, giving a pained grin as he reached for Professor M's throat. And Ysabel was wincing as she yanked the quarrel from her hip.

 The professor slashed his left-hand sword at Baldomero's neck. Baldomero skipped back, almost lazily. The blade whisked just below his chin. Blood stained the sword and Baldomero's jacket.

 The first Cat thought, Dad will die! The second thought, Good. The horror of the first Cat won. She looked down and thought, Not happening, not happening, not happening!

 Granny Lupe said gently, "Watch. And learn."

 "Please," Cat whispered, unable to think of what she wanted or what might happen or what might be best.

 The second Cat thought, Of course I should watch. Once I learn everything, I can do anything.

 So she looked up.

 Her father's attempts to cut Baldomero had brought him into the middle of the parlor. Baldomero and Ysabel dodged his blades as if they were dancing, and they laughed at their skill or his.

 Baldomero said, "Ask for mercy, Professor." Ysabel said, "He tried to kill our Miracle!" Baldomero said, "Did I say we would give it?" "Surrender, Professor," Granny Lupe said. "You can't escape." Professor M nodded. "Bait doesn't escape."

 Two steel grates dropped from the ceiling, one blocking the door to the hall, one blocking the window. In front of each, a ceiling panel flapped down. From each, a rifle with a barrel as wide as the bolt pistol fired into the room.

 Granny Lupe fell over Cat, knocking her to the floor. The bolt aimed at Cat pierced Granny Lupe's back with a sickening thud. Cat lay still, half-covered by her grandmother's limp body. The first Cat wanted to hide and needed to scream. The second thought, Play dead. The chance to strike back will come.

 She opened her eyes into slits. Baldomero struggled to stand with a bolt buried high in the right side of his chest. Granny Lupe stayed motionless on top of Cat. Ysabel lay sprawled on the rug, bright blood glistening on her red coat around the bolt in her heart. She took a rattling breath, then fell silent.

 The first Cat thought, I have to save someone! The second thought, Yes. Me. The professor dropped his swords and reached for a bolt rifle tossed down by a bald man dressed in brown: a safari jacket, cargo pants, and hiking boots. Cat knew his smell before she saw his face.

 Uncle Olujimi, with a bolt rifle in both hands and a machete sheathed at his side, dropped into the parlor as Auntie Fong, in a black jacket with a hood over her white hair, stayed on the floor above. Her rifle covered them all.

 The first Cat thought, It's a bad joke for my birthday. Fake blood. Toy weapons. Right?

 The second Cat thought, Why couldn't I smell them? Ah. The garlic wreaths upstairs. The professor planned this years ago. Why didn't I see the Medianoches are monsters?

 As Olujimi snapped his rifle butt to his shoulder and aimed at Baldomero's heart, Auntie Fong aimed at Granny Lupe's back, and Professor M aimed at Cat's throat.

 She stared into the enormous, dark barrel. His finger tightened on the trigger. She thought, No! I must live! They're evil!

 Then a voice, a sweet murmur, as though the speaker wanted to wake a sleeper gently, filled the parlor. "Valentin. Fong Shu. Olujimi Udofia."

 The first Cat thought, Who's that? The second thought, Salvation. The three attackers kept their aim at their targets. Olujimi said,

 "Who?" Auntie Fong shouted, "Shoot them!" Her hand trembled wildly, but her rifle didn't fire. The professor's finger rested against his trigger. He said in a voice neither Cat could recognize, "Zora?" The whispering voice came again, a little louder. "You know we're not your enemies." Olujimi said hesitantly, "It's a trick."

 Auntie Fong cried, "Fire! Now! Kill them!" Professor M said softly, "It can't be you." The weight of Granny Lupe's body was lifted from Cat so easily that

 Lupe seemed to float into the air. But when Cat looked up, she saw someone taller than Granny Lupe, almost as tall as Baldomero, someone whose skin was as smooth and brown as Cat's, and whose hair was as dark as a panther's. Her long black dress wasn't Granny Lupe's shapeless cotton. It was silk, a sheath of smoke. She looked at Professor M and smiled.

 The first Cat thought she had never seen anyone so terrifying. The second knew she had never seen anyone so beautiful. The first thought, Impossible. The second thought, Mama.

 Her father twitched like a man falling in a dream. His rifle swung from Cat to Zoraida de la Sombra and fired.

 Zoraida turned casually to let the bolt pass. As she did, Baldomero sprang. His right arm hung limp at his side, but he swatted aside Olujimi's rifle with his left and closed that hand around Olujimi's throat, lifting him onto the tips of his toes. As Olujimi gasped for air, Baldomero told Professor M and Auntie Fong, "He lives until you act."

 Olujimi clawed at Baldomero's fingers. Though Baldomero's face was ashen and grim, and blood seeped from the bolt in his chest, his grip did not open and his arm was as still and as strong as a statue's.

 Professor M said, "Understood."

 Looking at Zoraida and Baldomero, the first Cat thought, What are they?

 The second thought, What are we?

 Auntie Fong still aimed down at them from the ceiling. Her finger still twitched furiously, but it would not close on the trigger. Zoraida looked up and said lightly, "Drop the weapon."

 Auntie Fong swung her sights to Zoraida's heart. "No." "Now." Auntie Fong's hand quivered, and her eyes flicked wide. Then her hand steadied, and her eyes narrowed. "You can keep us from attacking you. You can't stop us from defending ourselves. If I believe any of us will die, I know I can shoot."

 Zoraida laughed. "Who fears what they can see and avoid?" Auntie Fong said, "Let me shoot now, if you're so sure." Zoraida shrugged. "Even if you get off a shot, you'll watch your family die." The first Cat thought, No! The second thought, Yes. End their threat.

 Olujimi gasped, "Fong Shu! Forget us!"

 Baldomero whispered, "Hush, Olujimi of the Udofias. Never hurry death."

 Auntie Fong told Zoraida, "Let them go. Then your family may leave."

 "Not all of us." Zoraida said, looking away. Cat followed her gaze. Ysabel's blood had stopped flowing. Her skin was like parchment. Both Cats thought, She can't be dead! Not Tia Ysabel!

 As Baldomero looked at Ysabel's body, his face contorted. He leaned forward as if he would fall to his knees. Then his lips and eyelids narrowed. He drew himself straight and told Zoraida, "They must die. They'll just kill and kill until--"

 Auntie Fong pointed the rifle at Cat. "Wait!" Zoraida shouted. The first Cat thought, Why are Dad's family so afraid of me? The second answered, Because they're wise. Cat said, "Please, Auntie Fong! I thought you loved me!" Auntie Fong shook her head. "I loved a girl who died at midnight." Zoraida told Auntie Fong, "We had a truce for fourteen years. Let it last until dawn." "Why should I trust you?" Professor M said, "Because she loves her daughter." Zoraida glanced at him, then said, "I thank you for that much." He added, "In her cruel, twisted--" "You never did know when to stop." "Explains why I married you." Zoraida raised an eyebrow. "Before I met you, I thought nothing of humans. Afterward, I thought even less." "Because you're a waking nightmare that only a fool could--" Auntie Fong said, "Val? Is there any point--" He slumped in his chair. "Is there ever?" The first Cat thought, Dad's suffering. The second thought, Not enough. Olujimi, gasping in Baldomero's grip, said, "What do we get? If we let you go?" Baldomero said, "Another day to dream of destroying us. What could be sweeter to your kind?" Auntie Fong nodded. "Truce. Until dawn." Baldomero looked at Ysabel, then Cat, and said softly, "Agreed." Something smelled bad in the room, worse than curdled milk and rotting eggs. Cat knew where it must come from. The first Cat thought, Tia Ysabel's really dead. She won't dance again. The second thought, Old Cat, you're stupid and boring and useless.

 Since Evil Dad didn't kill you, I will. Die now.

 Silence told her she had succeeded.

 Baldomero lowered Olujimi until his feet were flat on the floor, then released his neck. Olujimi rubbed the outline of fingers on his throat and rasped, "Hope to return the favor soon."

 A thin smile flickered across Baldomero's lips. Then he kicked the swords, rifles, and bolt pistol to the far corner of the room and strode to Ysabel's body. Starting to stoop, he winced and glanced at the bolt in his chest. He inhaled deeply, grabbed the bolt by its fins, wrenched it free, and screamed.

 Professor M said, "The neighbors will wonder about our parties."

 Zoraida said, "Some people get carried away on Halloween. I'm sure you can explain if the police stop by."

 Baldomero snapped the glistening shaft in half and dropped the pieces with the other weapons. His jacket and shirt were torn and bloody, but the cloth hid what the bolt had done to him. He knelt by Ysabel and stroked her hair.

 Zoraida said, "Here's how it's done, nephew." She reached behind herself and ripped the bolt from her back without making a sound. Sweat sprang from her forehead and cheeks. Cat smelled the stink of her mother's pain and hated her father's family even more.

 What did her mother think? Her face was unreadable as she watched Professor M. There was a truce here, but no trust.

 Baldomero reached toward Ysabel's face and whispered, "Dear mother--" Cat thought he would close her eyelids, but when he touched them, he pressed gently. Ysabel's body crackled and shattered like a shell of old paper. The stench of rotting things tripled in the room. All that remained of Cat's favorite aunt was dark, clotted blood.

 Olujimi covered his mouth and Cat's father grimaced. Neither Zoraida nor Baldomero let their faces change, so Cat did not either.

 Zoraida whispered, "Farewell, older sister."

 Ysabel had been the best aunt anyone could have, beautiful and laughing and generous. Cat wanted to mourn her, but she didn't know how.

 Something, maybe a movement, outside the parlor window made her turn. The moon was not up, but she could see into the yard. Two figures crouched in the shadows beneath the trees. Cat sniffed. If not for the garlic upstairs, would she have smelled the people outside? Why had she looked? Had she smelled their guns?

 All she knew was she had known to look. She said, "Someone's outside." Everyone in the parlor glanced at the window, then at her. Zoraida turned to Professor M. "Who is it?" He shook his head. Zoraida said, "Alexandra Arkan. And her boy?" Professor M shrugged. Cat thought, Ilya's a monster like Evil Dad? I knew there's a reason he bothered me. The old me. He bothers the new me, too. But the new me can make him sorry. The new me can make him stop bothering anyone.

 Zoraida said, "What is he? Fifteen? And that woman made him a killer?"

 Professor M said, "What've you made our daughter?"

 "We woke her. We didn't change her. Why do you think I waited so long to know what she is?"

 "Pretending to be someone else."

 "A small price for watching my daughter become herself." Zoraida smiled at Cat, and Cat grinned back

 Professor M looked at Baldomero. "Something in the wine." Baldomero nodded. "It didn't affect me." "What's in you to wake?" Baldomero looked up at Auntie Fong.

 "Call off your dogs." Auntie Fong shook her head. "You think anyone can tell Alexandra

 Arkan what to do?" "Tell her she may be safe from our will while she's alert. Ask if she'd like us to test the boy. Would she rather have him shoot his mother or himself?"

 Auntie Fong said, "I'm not lowering my gun to call."

 Baldomero shrugged. "As you wish. The boy could shoot his mother and then--"

 "I'll call." Professor M reached slowly into his pocket, showed them his cell, selected a number, then spoke into the phone. "Xandra, they spotted you. They'll control Ilya if you don't leave." He snapped the cell shut. "I'll spare you her exact words. They're going."

 Cat saw the shadowy figures moving away. The two she had seen were joined by three more. How many enemies did her true family have? The five outside got into a dark SUV and drove away.

 Baldomero said, "We'll follow their example." Zoraida added, "Cat first." Auntie Fong said, "Last. How else can I trust you?" "Because I go last."

 "If you wish to sacrifice yourself for her, I'll indulge you." Cat said, "No! Mama--" Zoraida smiled at her. "Our only plan is to leave. Cat goes first." Auntie Fong glanced at Professor M, then nodded.

 Baldomero said, "If Zoraida doesn't follow quickly, be assured, I'll be back faster than you can gather weapons."

 Zoraida told Cat, "Go, my darling."

 Cat took a last look at the bloody pool that had been Tia Ysabel, then turned and strode from Casa Medianoche. As she went, she wondered how she had seen her father's family as funny Uncle Olujimi, strong Auntie Fong, and boring Evil Dad. They were beasts. They did not deserve an instant of her thought.

 Besides, she was thirsty. 

 Chapter Six

 : An Unexpected Gift

 Walking onto the lawn, she saw the neighbors' cat. She stooped and said, "Here, Boswell. They should keep you indoors. Anything could happen to you." She held out her hand, wondering what would ease her thirst. A lemonade? A milk shake? A mango lassi? No. What could be better than a mango lassi?

 Boswell snarled, leaped backwards, then spun about and fled back to his house. As Cat heard the pet door close, Baldomero came down the steps of Casa Medianoche. "Sorry, Princess. No cats for Catalina unless you're fast."

 "They always liked me." Did Boswell's reaction bother her? She had planned to have dozens of pets when she was an adult in her own home.

 "Dogs will fear you at first, but they're good company for us. They'll warn you if someone comes while you sleep."

 Cat shrugged. Pets were part of Old Cat's concerns. "I'm thirsty." "Don't worry. We have something waiting for you." She looked at his bloody clothing. "I hate my father's family." Zoraida walked out of the house. "I have the brightest daughter." Cat hugged her, thinking Best mother ever, and said, "What about

 Tia Ysabel?" Baldomero straddled his bike. "We'll do what we always do when they kill one of us. We'll never forget her." He started the bike with a roar. "And we'll make sure they never do, either."

 Zoraida kissed Cat on both cheeks. "Ride with him, my fierce one." "But how'll you--" Zoraida smiled and became a black wolf. "The cool!" Cat said, then looked at Baldomero. "Who was the white one? The one who saved me from the Arkan's van?" He grinned. "Guilty as charged." "Can I be a wolf, too?" "Soon," he answered as they watched the black wolf lope down De

 Anza Street. "Wait till you run with us beneath the full moon. Then you'll know it's worth any price to be what we are."

 "What's that?" "The children of the night. The gray neighbors. The fair folk. The quiet ones. We are what we are. Their names for us don't matter." Did the black wolf run faster than real wolves could? As her mother disappeared around a corner, Cat asked, "Why do you have a bike?" "Enjoy all things, my princess." He raised a black helmet and held it toward her. "Do I have to?" "Honor Ysabel's last lesson. We aren't immortal. Wise bikers say you should spend as much money on your helmet as you think your head is worth. Yours, I assure you, is worth at least the price of that helmet to me, and should be to you, as well."

 "Oh." Cat let him lower the helmet over her head and fasten the strap. It smelled like him, something like mesquite smoke.

 "Now," he said, "hang on tight."

 Hugging his cool, lean body was easy. They sped across the yard, down the driveway, and onto the street. Cat shouted, "You don't have the headlight on!"

 "No one will notice." "But if the police see us--" "They won't notice seeing us." "Really?" "I'll never lie to you, Catalina. Really." She hugged him tighter. Only her father and his family had lied to her. They roared through downtown. The streets were nearly empty. She saw a few groups of people in nightclubbing clothes, a couple of police cars, a few homeless people. Though the motorcycle roared as they shot through red lights and sped past cars, no one looked at them.

 Cat checked their reflection in store front windows. They weren't invisible. They simply weren't noticeable.

 She said, "Can I do everything you can?" "Eventually," he shouted. "Maybe more!" "Ex!" He slowed near the Tucson Museum of Art. The neighborhood had been expensive once and was becoming expensive again as old homes were being restored. He parked behind a large Victorian house painted in red with gold and purple trim. A sign identified it as the Gold Mountain Bed & Breakfast.

 She caught a whiff of something she knew. Before she could recognize it, Baldomero opened the back door of the B&B. "Coming?"

 She nodded and hurried after him.

 The house had wallpaper with intricate patterns, oak wainscoting, glass door handles, brass fixtures, lampshades with tassels, and Persian rugs covering most of its gleaming wood floors. Cat smiled, then frowned.

 Baldomero said, "Something wrong?" "Evil Dad calls this Hollywood Whorehouse." "You don't like Hollywood Whorehouse?" "I don't like remembering Evil Dad." "None of us like remembering our lives before." A hint of sadness in his voice stopped her from asking "before what?" She knew: before becoming night people. It was strange to think of the de la Sombras having histories. She said, "Tia Ysabel always looked the same at my birthday! But I never thought it was odd."

 He nodded. "She did the don't-notice thing." "We do it without thinking. So humans will ignore small things that should seem odd about us." "Hypnotism." "The old word is glamour. Turn it up a little, and humans will like you without knowing why. Turn it up more, and they'll obey you, even if they hate you." He opened the front door and looked out at the tree- lined street.

 Cat smelled the night. Even near downtown, under the tang of automobile exhaust and gas furnaces and street tar, she knew the desert scents of plants and earth and animals. She liked them better than this house. The B&B stank of perfumes and air freshener and deodorant and humans.

 "Is Mama late?"

 Baldomero shook his head. "Wolves run about thirty miles an hour. Give her a minute or two."

 She wouldn't mind if her mother took all night. Cat liked being alone with her cousin. "Do we get old?"

 "Physically? If we want."

 "Good. Looking like a fourteen-year-old for more than a year would suck."

 He smiled. "You look fine." "I want to look twenty-one. I could go anywhere." He laughed. "Why rush? You've got all the time you want now to be anything you wish." She smiled up at him. "And do anything I want?" He grinned. Galaxies of possibility swirled in his golden eyes. She leaned toward him and thought, Kissing cousins. It's okay. He frowned. "Cat? You all right?" She nodded quickly and stepped back. Whatever she might be, whatever she might feel, she was a child to him. Would he laugh if she tried to kiss him? No. He was too nice. He would pity her. Nothing could be worse than his pity.

 How much of a kid was she, compared to him? He had started giving her costumes when she was one. If he'd been seventeen then, he was thirty-one now. In seven years, she would be twenty-one, and he would be thirty-eight. He wouldn't think she was too young then.

 "Baldomero? How old are you?" "Age doesn't matter. Only the spirit does." Maybe she should kiss him. "That's what I think." He nodded. "Except in romance. People who seek younger lovers are pathetic or exploitive or both. You have to pity anyone who falls for them."

 "Oh," she said softly, thinking, Great, even as a night person, I'm pathetic. She made herself laugh. "Yeah, kids like that are the sad. So you'd want to be with someone born in--?

 "1732?" He laughed. "Hardly! Give me someone fun, and she can be seventeen or seven hundred. Got anyone in mind?"

 "If I think of someone, I'll let you know." She thought, In two years, three hundred and sixty-four days, and twenty-three hours.

 The faint sound of padded feet running on asphalt came from the street. Almost as soon as Cat looked, Zoraida was walking up to the B&B. As she entered, she said, "Where are the servants?"

 Baldomero shrugged and closed the door behind her. Zoraida called, "We've returned! We thirst!" Cat heard doors flung open upstairs, then footsteps racing down carpeted steps. An Asian man and woman came in slippers, pajamas, and robes. The woman was pretty. Cat glanced from her to Baldomero, but he was ignoring the humans as he slumped into a chair. She understood. The humans made her uncomfortable. They seemed embarrassingly desperate for approval.

 She said, "You glamoured them?"

 He nodded. "In the most thorough way." He unzipped his jacket. His white shirt looked new. Cat squinted. So did his jacket. She glanced at Zoraida. They both wore the same clothes they had earlier, his gray leather, her black silk, but the clothes seemed new. What else could nighters do?

 Baldomero announced, "The usual for my sister and me." He looked at Cat. "Water for Catalina."

 "Of course," said the man. "At once," said the woman. Cat said, "Water?" Zoraida said, "There's something special for you later, my fury."

 Baldomero nodded. "It's your first night." His pronunciation made her hear capital letters: First Night.

 Well, it was her first night as a night person. Why shouldn't there be something special to go with it? "What?"

 "Nothing that can harm you." he said. "Don't worry."

 "We survived it." Zoraida patted the sofa beside her. "First indulge us, then indulge yourself."

 Cat dropped onto the cushion between her mother and cousin and said, "I love my family. My real family."

 Zoraida hugged her. "And your real family loves you." "True," Baldomero said. "As much as life itself." "More," said Zoraida. "My fury, you must have questions." Cat felt as if her mother had offered to tell her what her Christmas presents would be. She should say she would wait to be surprised. That's what Tarika would do.

 But Tarika was part of Old Cat's life. Why should New Cat care what a human would do? "How soon can I become a wolf?"

 "When you've learned what a wolf is." "Meaning?" "Some things are easier to show." "When can I try?"

 Zoraida glanced at Baldomero, said, "In a few days," and he nodded. "Can I turn into anything else?" "Anything you truly know, you can become." "Anything?"

 "Anything living that weighs more than three pounds and less than your human weight. The science of what we are is fascinating."

 "To your mother, anyway," Baldomero said. Cat said, "Why three pounds?" "Because even we have limits," he said. Zoraida added, "Perhaps because a human brain weighs about three pounds. The spinal cord adds a little over an ounce. Do you know about stem cells?"

 "My first night surprise is a science quiz?"

 Zoraida smiled. "In human embryos, stem cells have two properties, self-renewal and unlimited potency. Self-renewal means they can replace themselves and grow. Unlimited potency means they can become any kind of cell the body needs. Those properties weaken as humans age. But they grow stronger in us."

 Baldomero said, "Or it's magic." "Which only means it's science we don't understand yet."

 Baldomero nodded. "Or it's magic." Cat said, "So nighters are mutants?" "Perhaps," Zoraida said. "No one knows." "Or--" Baldomero began. "It's magic," Cat said with him, and they laughed together. She thought of her day and looked at her mother. "How much does a raven weigh?"

 "An average one? Two and a half pounds." "Oh." Zoraida smiled. "But once you know something, you don't have to imitate it exactly. If a raven's not near you, who notices if it's a little larger than average?"

 "You followed me to Ms Arkan's!"

 "I often stayed up to see you to school. Sometimes I woke early to check on you."

 "Then why are we called night people?" "As humans, we can't bear the sun. As animals, we can." "So why not stay animals? Isn't it fun?" "Very! But as animals, we rely more on instinct and less on thought

 --" Baldomero said, "Ah!" and Cat looked up. The servants came from the kitchen with three crystal juice glasses on a tray. Both servants had large Band-Aids on their left wrists. Cat wanted to ask how they had been identically clumsy, but the smell of the drinks took her attention.

 Two glasses held a deep red liquid. The third held water. The dark liquid smelled like strength and delight. She wanted to snatch both glasses and snarl at anyone who tried to stop her.

 As Zoraida and Baldomero drank, tipping their glasses back until they were empty, Cat thought, It's not tomato juice. It's something night people love. Would strawberry juice look and smell like that? She said, "Is this like an initiation? I get bread and water while you get the good stuff?"

 Baldomero set his glass on the tray. "You'll have the very best when you're done with your questions."

 "Okay. Done with questions." He laughed. "Learn all you can, my princess. Preparation matters." Zoraida handed her glass to the woman and said, "It'd be nice to have more." The woman's eyes went wide in fear, then narrowed. She said softly,

 "Of course, Ma'am." Baldomero said, "Don't exhaust them." Zoraida stuck out her lower lip. "I haven't indulged myself in fourteen years." She glanced at Cat. "Which I chose gladly. But now" "Patience, Aunt. Tomorrow, we'll drink to remember Ysabel, and you may have all you wish, and more." Baldomero glanced at the woman. "That's enough." A grateful smile flickered across the servant's face. She backed away quickly and stopped with the man by the wall. Baldomero told them, "You may retire. Don't be troubled by anything you hear tonight." As they bowed and went upstairs, Baldomero smiled at Cat. "More questions?" She nodded. "The Medianoches killed Tia Ysabel. Shouldn't we tell the police?" Zoraida and Baldomero stared at her. Cat added, "There's blood in the parlor. The police don't need a body, not if we say we weren't doing anything when they attacked." Zoraida looked at Baldomero. "What did you tell her?" "That we're night people. I didn't get to what that means." Cat said, "They'd believe us if you did the wolf trick. Then they could arrest the Medianoches for murder, and we could give magic shows in Las Vegas. We could be famous!"

 Zoraida shook her head.

 Cat said, "If people knew about us, the government couldn't kidnap us to experiment on us. Could they?"

 Zoraida said, "Your father and I let you watch too much television." Baldomero said, "Night folk avoid attention." Cat said, "It's a tradition thing?" "You could say that."

 Zoraida asked, "What do you think you are, my darling?"

 "Thirsty." Cat drained her water. It felt good on her throat, but it didn't ease her need for something richer.

 Zoraida said, "And?"

 Cat shrugged. "We're like witches? If people knew what we were, they'd try to burn us at the stake?"

 Zoraida nodded as Baldomero said, "Or worse." Cat said, "Witch hunts were centuries ago!" "Humans never change, my fierce heart," Zoraida said. "They hate us." "The people upstairs don't." Baldomero said, "We can only make a few servants." "You couldn't go on TV and glamour everyone?" He smiled and shook his head. "Would that we could." "But why do humans hate us?"

 "Because of our freedom. And our power."

 Zoraida glanced at Baldomero, then told Cat, "And we drink their blood."

 "Wait." Cat stared at her. "We're--" Zoraida nodded. Thinking she must have misunderstood, Cat said, "Vampires? Like, vampires?" Zoraida shrugged. "It's one of the names humans use." Baldomero added, "Werewolves. Ghouls. Wendigoes. There are many names, but what inferiors call you doesn't matter, so long as they fear you."

 Cat kept staring. Vampires and werewolves were made by the bite of another vampire or werewolf, right? They weren't girls who had their fourteenth birthdays and turned into something that was perfect in every way, except for the drinking human blood part. "Tia Ysabel didn't turn into dust."

 "The only thing less accurate than folklore is Hollywood."

 Baldomero said gently, "Choose any name for us you please, Catalina. We are what we are. Most of what they imagine is false. They're children afraid of the dark."

 "Truly," Zoraida said. "It's good to be of the folk, my fury." Cat said, "When we drink their blood, do they die?" Baldomero said, "If we drink deeply." "But we avoid killing," Zoraida said. "Alarm them, and someone like your father will come. We don't have to drink so much that we must kill. It's quite civilized."

 Cat nodded. It was good to be better than humans. It was smart not to alarm them. Why should drinking their blood bother her? She had tasted her blood whenever she cut her finger and licked the wound. It had never bothered her. She liked hamburgers and steak medium-rare. Her family was right. Why should she care what humans called the folk who were infinitely superior to them? She said, "Okay."

 Baldomero smiled at her. "Any more questions?" "When you turn back into yourself, do you get different clothes?" He laughed. "Focus on new clothes before you change. As a bird or a beast, it's best to plan on nothing more than your destination." Zoraida said, "When I was a girl, I would wear something new before changing, then return to myself in my favorite old dress. It drove your grandmother mad." Cat smiled. So her family were vampires? What family doesn't have quirks? She said, "The real Granny Lupe?" Zoraida nodded. "I'm sorry you only know her through my charade."

 "What happened to her?"

 "She died as most of us do. Killed by the assassins of the Night Council."

 "Who--"

 "Humans like your father, Olujimi Udofia, and Fong Shu." Zoraida shook her head. "I'm exhausted. It'll be nice to go to sleep early."

 "True," said Baldomero.

 If I'm supposed to drink blood, having a glass of it now would be nice. She said, "Don't forget I'm thirsty."

 He nodded. "Quenching thirst is the heart of every first night. Come."

 The B&B's stairway reminded her of Casa Medianoche. She told herself that stairs are only stairs. The upper floor was decorated--or over-decorated--like the one below. The hall had many doors. She suspected the B&B lost a lot of business when Baldomero stayed there.

 The smell of humans was stronger upstairs. The smells of perfume, deodorant, and air freshener grew stronger, too. She wrinkled her nose in disgust.

 Baldomero said, "We have beds in the basement. But if you're up late, don't worry. There are heavy curtains on every window, and the Changs know better than to draw them."

 "Why would I be up late?" "That depends on how quickly you choose to drink." Cat laughed. "I'm dying of thirst. I bet I'm in bed before you." Zoraida gripped her shoulder. "Don't be so sure, my fierce one. You didn't ask two important questions." "Which ones?" Zoraida smiled fondly. "Why do we call you our miracle?" Cat said, "Because that's what my middle name means?" Baldomero said, "Your mother scoffs, but there is a prophecy. One born between the worlds will lead the folk to glory." Cat stopped to stare at him. "Me? That's silly." "There's never been another like you, a child of the folk and the humans." Zoraida said, "Your uncle isn't the only one who believes it. True or not, it'll help you rise to greatness with us. Believe me, timing your birth so precisely was not easy, my fury, not even for one of us."

 Cat smiled. When she was small, she had wanted to be a fairy princess. Being a princess of the night folk had to be as good. It might be better. "What's the other question?"

 Zoraida stroked Cat's hair, then said, "How do we learn to control our thirst?"

 "We don't just do it?"

 Baldomero shook his head. "No one has mastered it without killing the first humans they drank from. They say one of the folk in China learned after his second. I think that's a myth. I know of no one who killed fewer than four."

 He stopped in front of the door at the end of the hall, then opened it. "Here's your first."

 On the bed, eyes wide in terror, mouth gagged with a white scarf, body writhing in a desperate attempt to escape, ankles and wrists bound behind her back with steel cuffs, the source of the familiar scent Cat had noticed when she approached the house--

 Tarika. 

 Chapter Seven

 : Thirst

 Drink! Cat thought, and took two steps into the room. Something inside her screamed, No! and she fell hard onto the floor. What screamed inside was screaming outside, too. She could hear it echo in the room. Zoraida seized Cat's wrists and said, "My fury! Think!"

 How could she? What she craved lay before her, but its source was her best friend.

 Old Cat's best friend.

 Old Cat who loved cheeseburgers, hot dogs, fried chicken, and tuna salad. Food is food. Who cares what it comes from? Take it!

 But this food had a name. Cat said, "It's Tee." Zoraida nodded. "Someone else. Anyone. Please. Someone I don't know." Baldomero said, "You must learn control."

 "Not Tee!" Was Old Cat in tears, or New Cat, or both? "It's the only way." "No! Baldomero, please, please, no!" "Each night, someone you love will be given to you. Tomorrow, your father. Then Olujimi Udofia, then Fong Shu, then a favorite teacher or a school friend. Until you learn control."

 All people whose lives had made hers happier. "Give me strangers. Baldomero, please!"

 He shook his head sadly. "If strangers mattered, humans would never make war. I can't count the strangers I killed before I learned control."

 "Please, if you love me--"

 "With all my heart, Catalina. That's why you must learn quickly. Nighters who can't control themselves are hunted and killed. Or they hate themselves so much they go out to greet the dawn."

 "Not Tee. Don't give me Tee." "Who then? Your father?" "No!" "Someone from school?" "No, please!"

 "Then I'm sorry, Catalina. You'll learn. And afterward, you'll honor your friend's memory for what she taught you."

 "No! You can't make me do this!"

 Zoraida said, "My brave one? That's true. So we'll leave you now. Come to the basement when you're done."

 "Catalina?" Baldomero said. She glanced at him, and he added firmly. "You will not drink from any other human." His voice was quiet as something cut through her panic, a command she could not ignore. "Only this girl is permitted to you. You will not break her bonds or help her escape. You will not leave this house. You will not do anything to harm yourself or any of our kind."

 Each word was a padlock closing.

 Cat looked from Baldomero to Tarika, who lay still, listening intently. "Please, Baldomero--"

 "I'm sorry, Catalina. You'll understand in time." He turned, then looked back with such sadness that she thought he would say she didn't have to do this after all. He said, "Be quick. If you wait for the feeding madness, you'll learn nothing. Then your friend's death will only be an incentive to act sooner next time." He went out.

 Cat spun to face Zoraida. "Mama! Don't do this!"

 "I'm sorry, little--" Zoraida reached to touch Cat's arm. As Cat jerked back, Zoraida said, "It's for the best."

 "Who did you kill?" "My first? A boy. Fernando. I thought I would marry him someday." "And then?" "Does it matter?" "Yes! How many will I kill?" Zoraida glanced at Tarika, then at the window's heavy drapes. "My nanny was next. I loved her more than my mother. But when I had to drink--" She shook her head. "Two after that. Then I could control it." Zoraida looked at Tarika. "Baldomero's right. Don't drag this out."

 "She's my best friend!" "I know. So don't make her suffer more than she must." Cat stared at her. "You chose her." "Do you think that was easy? I always liked Tarika." "How could you?" "If ever you're a mother, you'll understand hard choices." "If you loved me--" Cat halted, remembering her midnight birth as one of the folk. "Baldomero put something in the wine." "Blood. To trigger the change." "You could've stopped him." "Something would've triggered it eventually. Better you change now, with your family here to help you." "You should've killed me." "I told my parents that, too." Zoraida looked at Tarika. "It's sad for them, but they are what they are, and we are what we are. Enjoy what you've been given."

 "No way! I swear--" Zoraida stood. "I'm helping you put off the inevitable. I'll go." "Mama!" Cat shouted, but Zoraida stepped out and closed the door. Cat gasped, trying to breathe, trying to stop crying. Old Cat was not dead, but if Tarika died, the old Cat would die with her. She ran into the hall. Her mother was going downstairs. Cat shouted, "Dad should've killed you! You're a monster, and you want me to be just like you, but I'm not! I'll never be!" Zoraida looked back. Her face was as as much a mask as Professor

 M's. She said softly, "I love you, daughter." Then she turned and continued downstairs.

 Cat whirled, raced back into the room, slammed the door, and ran to the bed where Tarika lay. "Tee, I can't--"

 She wanted to say she could never hurt her. But she saw the pulse in Tarika's throat and wrist. Her veins were delicate and strong, simple and beautiful. They carried all that Cat needed. They carried life.

 She shook her head to clear it, then reached for the cuffs binding Tarika's wrists and ankles behind her. The cuffs were closed over each other, keeping her arms and legs folded back so she could not straighten out.

 Could nighters break steel? Cat gripped the cuffs, but she couldn't pull on them. She tried, straining fiercely, feeling the effort across her chest, yet her arms stayed limp. At last, she dropped her hands and whispered, "Tee. I can't break them."

 Tarika's face contorted as she tried to speak around the scarf. Cat said, "He didn't mention the gag!" She grabbed the cloth and snapped it as if it were tissue.

 Tarika whispered, "We gotta get out of here!" Cat shook her head. "I can't." "Because you're afraid?" "Because he ordered me. It's glamour. Like hypnotism." Tarika nodded. "Not worrying now. Do you know where the keys are?" "If I did, I still couldn't help." "Not what I asked." "Oh. Right. Sorry. No. I don't know." "Okay. That's good. You can help me as long as you're not helping me." "Which means?" "We'll figure this out. We just have to think it through." "I'm thinking, Tee. It's not good." "Maybe they hypnotized you into thinking you're something you're not. You're my best friend, and we're getting out of here. That's all you have to think about."

 "I'm thirsty."

 "Stop it, Cat! You're freaking me worse, which I totally didn't think was possible. Are they really your family?"

 "Yes. And they're really vampires. Or werewolves. Or something that's not--"

 "Stop it! Focus on the getting out." "I'm one, too." "What part of 'stop it' is too hard? We're getting out. Got it?" "I want you out, Tee. More than anything. But I can't go unless

 Baldomero says so." "For sure?"

 "Like I'm sure I can't get your cuffs off."

 "Okay, thinking. He didn't say you should stop me from trying to escape. You just can't help me."

 Hope surged in Cat. "That's right!"

 "So if I escape, he'll have to change his mind about what you can do." Tarika hesitated. "Really vampire-werewolves?"

 Cat opened her mouth to answer.

 Tarika shook her head. "No. Keep thinking they're hypnotists who messed us up."

 Cat nodded. "Could be."

 Tarika pursed her lips, then said softly, "No. I'd remember if your teeth were that long."

 Cat touched her tongue to her canines. They were sharp, perfect for biting through-- She thought, Not Tee! She made herself say calmly, "What'll we do?"

 "I don't know." "Really thirsty." "Ignore it." "Can't."

 "Cat. I love you. Remember--"

 "I know! I love you, Tee." Cat gasped, then said, "But it hurts, and it's hard to think, and it's not that I don't love you, really, but--"

 "Cat!" She had stepped closer to Tarika without realizing it. She jumped back. "What?" Tarika looked over her shoulder at her cuffs. "Make me more comfortable?" "Huh?"

 "Being folded up like this. It's really uncomfortable." "I don't know." "He didn't say you couldn't make me comfortable!" Tarika's eyes were moist and red. Cat had never seen her terrified.

 Baldomero's right. I shouldn't torment her. But I can't just kill her!

 Cat said, "Sure. I can do something. To make this easier for you." She reached for the cuffs and thought, I only want to make Tee more comfortable.

 But her hands weren't fooled. Tee's wrists are so warm. Her skin is such a beautiful brown. How much of its color comes from her blood?

 As Cat bent over her, Tarika said, "Cat? You don't have to do this. Cat! You're freaking me, please--"

 It would be so easy to end Tee's suffering and her own. Leaning into Tarika's throat, Cat whispered, "Don't be afraid. I love you, Tee."

 She heard Tarika's sigh. She felt her relax, as all Tarika's fear was drawn from her. This was glamour, Cat realized. It was useful. It was merciful. She had learned something.

 Now she only needed to learn what it was like to drink until she could drink no more. Then they would both be free.

 Her lips brushed Tarika's neck. Must drink. It's best for everyone. Drink. Blood is life. Choose life. Drink. Now!

 As her teeth grazed Tarika's skin, a thought surfaced in Cat's mind:

 You will not drink from any other human.

 She threw herself back from Tarika. She didn't know if she tasted blood or sweat. She didn't dare look at Tarika to see. She spat on the floor and ran into the hall.

 She felt as if she was fighting her way through quicksand. Every step said, Turn back! Drink!

 But if she went back, she would drink without stopping. If she slowed at all, the call from the bedroom would force her to answer. She ran harder than she had ever run, forcing her way to the head of the stairs and plunging down them, stumbling on the steps, catching the railing to keep from falling, then flinging herself over the rail and onto the lower floor.

 Through the living room. Down the main hall. Into the kitchen, a gleaming place of green marble and burnished brass. To the bright steel refrigerator, large enough to serve a restaurant.

 She yanked the doors open. A pitcher of water. Drink!

 She gulped water from its spout, spilling twice as much as she drank, pouring it down her throat until it was empty.

 But she wasn't full. A gallon of milk. Drink! She tore off the cap, put the jug to her mouth, tipped it back, and chugged. Milk tasted like a slurry of grease with globs of fat. She forced herself to drink until she knew one more swallow would make her vomit.

 She threw the jug aside, grabbed a cola bottle, and swigged. It was like drinking sugar melted in ammonia. She puked everything she had drunk onto the floor, then stood there, leaning against the refrigerator, trembling and weak, soaked in cold sweat.

 But the thirst still burned.

 Only the thought of saving Tee made her grab the next bottle and drink. Orange juice. Better, but its sweetness threatened to rise in her throat. She threw it, too.

 A carton of tomato juice. She drank deeply. It almost tasted good, but she needed something it could not give. She threw the empty carton aside and reached for what was next.

 Root beer. As bad as cola. She threw it after a sip. Ginger ale. Just as bad. Thrown. A bottle of wine. Could she drink that? If she got drunk, would she stop trying to stay away from the far bedroom? She pulled out the stopper and sipped. It burned her throat and made her cough. Thrown.

 She snatched the carton next to the wine, ripped off its cap, and drank. It was not what she wanted, but something in it steadied her. Something in it fed her. Desperately, gratefully, she tipped the carton back, draining it, then finally licking its top.

 She dropped the carton, reached for a bottle of mineral water, then stopped.

 The thirst was weaker. Was she lying to herself? If she went upstairs, would she feed? She snatched up the carton and read the label. Nine grams of protein per serving. It had been nearly full when she started drinking. She must have drunk at least three and a half servings. Low fat. Did that mean she would've liked milk better if it had been skim instead of whole? Organic. Did that mean she couldn't drink things grown with chemicals?

 She turned the front of the carton toward her. Soy milk. Unsweetened. She looked in the fridge. Wasn't tofu made from soy beans? It didn't matter. There was no tofu in the fridge.

 She needed protein. A block of cheddar cheese. She tore open the plastic, shoved the cheese in her mouth, and almost gagged at the taste and smell of rotten milk. She started to throw it, saw the mess she had made, and set it on the counter.

 She opened a zip-top of pork chops. The stench of long-dead flesh was worse than the stink of cheese.

 Blood is life, she thought. Can anything substitute for blood from a living person?

 She looked again at the crumpled carton. Protein. What else had protein?

 She wrenched open a jar of peanut butter. It was salted. She hesitated before moving her nose close, then smiled. Blood is salty. Salt, good.She scooped out a blob with her fingers and licked it. Peanut butter tasted creamy. If she couldn't eat things made from milk, peanut butter might be her new dessert.

 She ate half the jar. It made her feel too full, too groggy. She needed something to clear the taste. She burrowed through the vegetable crisper and found a stalk of broccoli. As she ate, she thought, Dracula and the Wolfman never ate their veggies.

 That almost made her laugh. Then she remembered talking with the Sanchezes about pets. Dogs and cats get sick if they only eat meat. Why should nighters be different?

 Looking around the kitchen, she felt sorry for the Changs, but she had more important things to do than tidy up. Was she free of Baldomero's glamour?

 She thought about leaving the house and knew she couldn't. She had won time, not freedom.

 She thought about Tarika and knew she had not won much time. Her thirst was weaker, but it was waiting. As she thought about it, she felt it growing again.

 Three possibilities remained. They all terrified her.

 Telling herself to act, not think, she grabbed a steak knife in both hands and plunged it toward her heart. But she remembered, You will do nothing to harm yourself. As the tip of the knife pricked the skin beneath her sternum, her arms locked up.

 She thought, I hate you, Baldomero. I hate you, Mama. You're cruel and evil, and you should die.

 But she could not carry the knife toward the basement. She could only remember his words: Or any of our kind.

 And she knew that even if she killed the monsters she loved, she would still be trapped in this house with her thirst and her best friend.

 It was hard to think as her mind filled with, Only this girl is permitted to you. 

 Chapter Eight

 : What Lies Below

 Tarika was lying quietly on the bed, her arms and legs still folded behind her, her eyes closed, her breathing easy. Her neck was scratched, but the skin was not broken. The pulse in her throat beat steadily and strongly. Cat wanted to drink without waking her. For a stranger, that might be a kindness. But her best friend deserved to choose how she died.

 Cat ordered, "Tee? Wake up!"

 Tarika's eyes flickered. "Cat?" Then her mouth snapped shut, her eyes opened wide, and she jerked back on the bed.

 Cat said, "It's okay! I'm safe for now. I can make you feel calm if you want. But I don't want to make you do anything."

 "You're sure?" "I pigged out in the kitchen. It took the edge off." "Totally?" Cat swallowed, then said, "A little. I still need to drink." Tarika gasped. "I can't kill myself. I can't kill Baldomero or Mama." Something warm and wet was sliding down Cat's cheeks, telling her she was crying. "I don't want to hurt you! But I can't disobey him, and I can't get rid of the thirst, and sooner or later, I'll have to-- Tee. If you can think of a way to kill me--"

 "Don't say that!" "To save yourself!" Tarika began crying, too. "I can't kill my best friend!" "One of us has to!" "I don't care! If you have to and I don't, then I won't! No way never!" "Not just for you, Tee. To save others." "They said you'll be able to control yourself!" "But after how many? Four? Five? One is too many, Tee." Tarika closed her eyes. Her breathing calmed, telling Cat that she had thought of something. "Cat? I can't--" Tarika gulped air, then said, "I can't do anything in these handcuffs."

 Cat shook her head. "I can't help you escape." "Can you carry me to the front door?"

 Cat stepped forward, then felt herself freeze, and shook her head. "That'd be helping. I want to, but--"

 "Okay. What time is it?"

 Cat pulled her cell from the pocket of her hoodie. "Five fifty-one. Why?"

 "We should know what time it is. When the sun comes up, we might have to adjust the curtains. Put the cell by the bed where you can see it." Cat shook her head again. "Nice try, Tee." The cell went back into the pocket of her hoodie. "You can't even leave it out?" "If you call Evil Dad, he'll come with the rest of them. Which might be best, but Baldomero said I can't do anything to harm any of us." "What about the police?" "They couldn't stop Baldomero. Or Mama. Or, if I'm all mad-hungry by then, me." "What about my folks?" "What would you say? Either they'd send the police because you're kidnapped, or they'd come because you're crazy. And Mama knows I love your folks. She might make them my next-- You know."

 Tarika bit her lower lip, then glanced back at the cuffs. "Where do you think the keys are?"

 "On Baldomero, I bet." "Could you get them?" Cat shook her head. "Helping." "Oh. Carry me downstairs for some water?" "Why not bring a glass up here?" "Did he say you can't carry me downstairs?" It would be easier for Tarika to escape if she was downstairs. But she was right. Baldomero didn't say Cat couldn't make it easier for Tarika-- he only said she couldn't help her. Was there a difference between helping her escape and letting her escape? The question stung like killer bees attacking her brain, but she focused on, Not helping, just carrying.

 She picked Tarika up easily, then said casually, "Getting water now." She felt hopeful for an instant, then told herself, Water for Tee. It's fine. Water doesn't break any of Baldomero's orders.

 She carried Tarika through the hall and down the stairs. Each step was a little harder, but she kept pushing, trying not to think, trusting her forward motion to keep her going. Not helping Tee escape. Just getting water.

 At the front door, Tarika said, "Set me down." Cat couldn't even slow as she kept walking. "Sorry, Tee."

 Tarika said softly, "It's okay, Cat."

 Failing her friend was bad enough. Knowing that Tarika forgave her made it worse. But knowing Tarika was being brave for her meant she had to be brave for Tarika, no matter how little hope she saw.

 But in the kitchen, seeing the mess she had made, she saw hope. Tarika, with her arms and legs bound behind her, couldn't sit on a stool. If Cat put her on the floor, Tarika would be uncomfortable and wet. So Cat said as if it was no big deal, "I'll set you in the hall, and then I'll get you some water."

 "Not really thirsty."

 The bees began stinging Cat's brain again. "You wanted water! Right?"

 "Oh, right! Yes. Please. Water would be great."

 Cat carried Tarika into the hall and set her in a kneeling position on a Persian rug. "How's that?"

 Tarika waddled forward on her knees. "Good."

 Cat went into the kitchen and poured a glass of water. When she returned, she saw Tarika had walked on her knees to the front door and was staring helplessly at the handle. She said, "Cat? Got a reason to look outside?"

 "To see if the sun is up so I can die screaming, 'Aargh, the sun!'?" Tarika gave her a small smile. "A better reason." Cat stared at her, then grinned. "He said I couldn't go out! He didn't say I couldn't look!" "No dying screaming?" "Not if I stay behind the door." "Ex." Cat opened the door a crack. The sky was lighter, but the sun was still below the mountains. Which way did the B&B face? Downtown was east, and it was on her left. Which meant the house faced north, so sunlight couldn't come in the front door. Cat opened it wide, saying, "If you try to go out, I'll have to shut it to stop you."

 "Just give it a little push to close it."

 Cat pushed the door gently. Tarika blocked it with her shoulder. Cat winced as the bees came back, angrier than before. Tarika said, "No helping here, Cat. I caught the door myself."

 "Hurts my head." "Sorry. But you're not helping." "Not helping, good. But if I see you leaving, I'll have to--" "More water would be nice." The bees swarmed so furiously that Cat could barely see. She thought, I can get her water! Water is just water! As the swarm grew quiet, Cat said, "How about tea? If you're not in a hurry, I could look for a pot, and then wait until it boils, and then I could hunt for some tea--"

 Tarika nodded. "I love tea."

 "Good. I'll get you some tea." Cat nodded to Tarika and started for the kitchen, thinking, Don't cry. This is not goodbye forever. This is just getting tea.

 "Cat?" she heard. "You're the best friend ever."

 Cat looked back. "No way. I couldn't, you know, get tea for you if, you know, you weren't the best friend ever."

 Tarika opened her mouth as if to answer, then closed her eyes. Cat saw a tear as Tarika looked away.

 And the thirst began rising in her.

 Cat turned away, saying, "Got to make tea now. See you, um, soon." She walked quickly into the kitchen, thinking, First, I will make a very thorough search for a tea pot. Rule out the least likely places right away. Don't think about being thirsty. Don't think about how quickly anyone could walk on her knees or how hard it'll be to go down the front steps. I can't go outside. Baldomero didn't say I should do anything if Tee escapes. I don't care how bad my thirst gets. I don't care about anything except making tea, then going into the hall with a cup for Tee. And if I don't find her, I'll see if Baldomero's command will let me go to sleep without telling anyone what happened.

 Cat opened the cupboard nearest the door. It was full of spices, a terrible place to put a tea pot. She should move everything out of it just to be sure there wasn't a pot at the back, so she began rummaging.

 Tarika called softly, "Cat?" She ran back to the hall. Tarika held the door ajar with her shoulder. "What's wrong?" Cat asked, then saw the answer. An orange van was parking down the street. On its side was painted "Arkan Exterminators."

 Was this a weird coincidence? How many people were in the van? Was her father with them? What did they want? Cat doubted they would do anything immediately. If they were hunting nighters, wouldn't they wait for full daylight?

 She said, "Doesn't matter. I'll get you some tea now." "Cat--" "It doesn't matter!" "They'll kill you!"

 Cat clapped her hands to her head as the bees struck. "La-la-la, so what? Problem solved! Getting tea now!"

 "I won't leave you to die!"

 "Tee, what part of 'There's no choice' don't you get?" "All of it! Look at you! You were going to kill me, and now--" "I still will, if I don't get you some tea!" "You don't know that! There has to be a solution!" Cat made herself be calm. "Sure. The Arkans know what it is. That's why they're here." "They tried to kill you! Won't they try again?" Cat shrugged. Tarika glared at her. "You are the worst liar ever." "Tee. Nothing's changed." "I'm not leaving you to die." "If you stay, I'll drink--" Tarika jerked her head sideways, exposing her neck. "Then drink." Cat stared at the pulse of her best friend's life. The strange tingling grew high in the front of her mouth. She flicked her tongue forward. Her canines were longer and sharper. She hid her teeth with her hand and shook her head. "I won't kill you!"

 "Then don't." "Tee--" "You want me to live. I want you to live. You can't leave until you drink, right? Then we can both escape, right?" "If I don't--" Tarika nodded. "You can't kick me out." Cat stared at her, then whispered, "No. No way." Tarika nodded. "It's on me. Whatever happens." Cat looked into Tarika's dark eyes and saw herself pleading there.

 "Tee--" "Tell me afterward." "But--" "The longer you wait, the thirstier you get, right?" Cat knelt and hugged her. "I love--" "After!" Tarika ordered. Please, God, don't let me drink a drop more than I need! she thought, putting her head next to Tarika's, then her mouth to Tarika's smooth, warm throat. She parted her lips, tasting dried sweat on Tarika's skin, feeling her teeth slide into Tarika's flesh. Warmth and salt washed her tongue. With the odd tingle, her teeth drew back like claws retracting. Tarika's blood flowed freely, and Cat drank.

 She didn't think. She knew that blood is iron and power and life, that the world is rich with blood, that she should drink it all, that the body feeding her was young and strong and healthy. If its blood was like veal, would an adult's be like steak? She would find out.

 The body of the blood tried to push her away. An annoying murmur came from far away. She wanted to ignore it, but she knew the words. "Cat? Stop. Cat! Stop. Time to stop, Cat. Stop it!"

 She thought, Quiet! and the struggling ceased. Controlling the creature that fed her was easy. Controlling everything but her own desire was easy. Why should she want to control herself? Needs should be satisfied. Why should she care if a human--

 A human called Tarika. Who thought it was wrong to kill animals for food. The human was wrong. The weak live to serve the strong. Cat was strongest of all. Who could strop her from drinking? Not a weak creature--

 Not a human girl-- Not her best friend-- Not Tarika-- Not--

 Cat jerked her mouth from Tarika's neck and cried, "Tee? Tee! Please, Tee!"

 Tarika's eyes were closed. Hollywood had part of vampirism right: two dark dots marked her throat. But Hollywood never showed the bruised flesh around the marks, or how the trickling blood stopped flowing from them.

 Tarika's chest wasn't moving. Had the bites stopped bleeding because her heart had stopped? Cat shook her. "Tee! Please! Come on, God, please--"

 Tarika's eyes flickered. Cat said, "Tee?" Tarika smiled weakly. "I knew you could." Cat hugged her tight. "Oh, thank God, Tee!" "Vampires can say that?" "Guessing yes. How do you feel?" "Guessing weak. You?" "Strong. No guessing." Cat grabbed Tarika's handcuffs and pulled as hard as she could. But her fingers went limp, and her hands slipped free. Tarika said, "Not strong enough?" Cat grabbed the front door handle, thinking she would step out into the shade of the house, even if the Arkans saw her. And her hand slid off the door knob. "Cat? What?" "I can't help. The rest of what he said still applies." "But you're not thirsty!"

 She considered that. "No. I had enough." She knew why that didn't make her feel better. Tarika was safe from her now, but not from her mother, Baldomero, or the Arkans.

 Tarika nodded. "Plan B." "Which is?" "The handcuff keys. You have to get them." "That's the helping I can't do." "The Arkans are outside, right? If they find me like this, what'll they think? No matter what I say, they'll search the house. But if I'm free, I can tell them you all left, and they'll believe me."

 "You'd lie for us?"

 "Does it matter? Aren't I right? To save your family, you have to take the chance, right?"

 Cat heard the bees returning, but she whirled and ran through the house.

 She didn't want to open the basement door. She was sure her mother and Baldomero would be standing there, waiting for her. She told herself that Granny Lupe had always slept soundly, so she shouldn't worry about waking them.

 But she worried. As Granny Lupe, her mother had slept in a place where she felt safe. Would she sleep lightly in a strange place? How soundly did Baldomero sleep?

 The door opened silently, revealing her next worry: The windows were covered with cardboard and duct tape. She might have great night vision as a nighter, but in perfect darkness, she was still blind.

 A flashlight hung from a nail by the light switch. She took it, then saw a dust rag on another nail. She wrapped it around the flashlight lens, pointed the lens at her feet, and turned it on. The dim light was enough to show her where she was about to step.

 She kept it aimed down to keep from disturbing the sleepers. She took each step slowly and carefully, but each step sounded impossibly loud.

 Then she thought, What if Mama and Baldomero lied about how many people they killed?The basement could be full of their victims' corpses.

 She wanted to run back. She should let Tarika call the police. Or Dad. Maybe he could stop the Arkans and the de la Sombras.

 A board creaked underfoot. She froze. The basement was cool and silent. She could hear a movement upstairs that must be Tarika in the hall. She could hear nothing in the basement. Had Zoraida and Baldomero left without telling her?

 She slowly raised the light. She saw an empty folding cot and fought the urge to gasp. Was one of them awake?

 She moved the light around the room. Something dark lay on a sofa: Zoraida in her black dress.

 Cat clamped a hand over her mouth and pointed the light down. She still saw her mother in her mind. Zoraida de la Sombra looked like Sleeping Beauty. Maybe it was natural for nighters to sleep deeply.

 Cat moved the light toward the next dark shape. A ping-pong table. With a yoga mat. And Baldomero like a sleeping Prince Charming.

 She couldn't step closer. The bees swarmed in full force. What she had done so far, she might have done on her own, looking for her bed after feeding. Anything more would be helping Tarika escape.

 She thought, If the Arkans find Tarika handcuffed, they'll kill us all. Go away, bees! I'm saving Mama and Baldomero!

 Her feet were freed so quickly that she fell toward Baldomero. She caught herself a few inches from his body and leaned back, almost sighing in relief.

 Do it and get out, she thought. She made herself slip a hand into his nearest jacket pocket.

 It was empty. What do nighters need to carry, besides the occasional handcuff key?

 She reached across his body for the other pocket. It was almost like hugging him. She knew she should hate him, but he looked so handsome and gentle and helpless. Part of her wanted to hug him.

 Until a hand like a steel claw grabbed her arm. 

 Chapter Nine

 : The Uninvited

 Cat opened her mouth to scream, then clamped her lips firmly together. Baldomero tugged her close and whispered, "Mi corazon." The stubble of his jaw pressed against her cheek. His eyes stayed firmly shut.

 She thought, If he wakes-- He whispered, "Kiss me." She froze. His hand tightened on her arm. He said, with a little doubt, "Mi amor?" What could she do? What should she do? She quickly kissed his cheek. He sighed, and smiled, and released her arm. Part of her was sad. Maybe his glamour worked while he slept.

 Maybe hating him didn't affect her attraction to him. She thought, Not thinking about that!

 She reached into his far pocket, found a small key, and backed quickly away. Neither sleeper stirred. She tiptoed upstairs, closed the door carefully, and ran into the front hall, waving the key.

 Tarika whispered, "I knew you could!" "Best lie." "No lie." Tarika smiled, so Cat smiled back, thinking, That's the only kind of lie that friends tell each other.

 She held out the key. "If the Arkans come, you'll say everything's fine?"

 Tarika nodded.

 Protecting my family, she thought, unlocking the cuffs. As Tarika stretched out straight and groaned, Cat glanced outside. The orange van had not moved. Cat said, "Better go out the back. They won't worry about nighters sneaking out in daylight."

 "What about you?" "Still can't leave." "If I push you out?" "'Aargh, the sun?'" "We could put a blanket over you." "I don't trust anything that works on TV." "We've got to do something!"

 "Yeah. You've got to go."

 "I said I wouldn't!" "And get help." "From who?" Cat bit her lips. Why hadn't she realized how wonderful it was to know her father would help her, no matter what? Now he would think anything she said was a trick and try to kill her on sight.

 She grabbed Tarika's hand and dragged her down the hall. "Just go. Soon as you're out, I'll wake Mama and Baldomero. They'll figure something."

 "If they can't?" "That might be best." "You're not all I-vant-to-suck-your-blood! You're still Cat. You proved it!" "Okay, once you're out, tell Dad everything. He can't make things worse." Tarika paused at the back door. "Hating leaving you." "And your brill alternative is?" "Not. I'll call your dad." "Thanks, Tee." Tarika unlocked the door, glanced at Cat, and began to wave. And the door swung inward, knocking Tarika into Cat's arms. As Cat looked up, she saw Alexandra Arkan in the doorway, silhouetted by the sun.

 Which bathed her in its light. Cat opened her mouth to yell, took a step back, and stopped. Sunlight felt like being near a hot stove, uncomfortably warm but not painful. Shouldn't it burn? Did Hollywood get vampires and daylight wrong?

 Confused and half-blind, she lifted her hand to shield her eyes. Ms. Arkan, in a gray leather blazer, dark green trousers, and low black shoes, was raising a bolt pistol in both hands. On her finger was a silver ring, a snake wrapped around a ruby.

 Tarika kicked the door as Ms. Arkan fired. Cat saw the sharp wooden bolt, heard an explosion like a balloon bursting, saw the bolt would miss her, and let it careen down the hall, shattering paintings and gouging wallpaper until it slammed into a china cabinet with a crash louder than the sound of it firing.

 Ms. Arkan shoved the door wide, pushing Tarika back, sending her skittering across the tile floor, and whispered fiercely, "Shoot!"

 Someone smaller was coming up beside her. Cat said, "Ilya?"

 He had a bolt pistol aimed at her chest. The sun made his hair redder than she remembered. He wore his denim jacket, jeans, and black running shoes. They stood six feet apart. Could she dodge a bolt fired so close?

 Keeping his pistol steady, he said, "Cat?" Ms. Arkan said, "It's only another nighter! Shoot!" Tarika screamed, "Sun!" Ilya squinted at Tarika, then at Cat. Ms. Arkan grabbed his pistol. "Damn it, Ilya!" "Sunlight!" Tarika yelled, pointing at Cat. Ilya's eyes opened wide. He hit his mother's wrist, knocking it against the door frame. The bolt pistol hit the floor and slid across the gleaming tiles.

 Tarika snatched it up, pointing it at the Arkans. Ms. Arkan said, "You don't know how to fire that." Tarika said, "So if I squeeze this trigger, nothing will happen?" Ms. Arkan said carefully, "You don't know the dangers here." Ilya turned to his mother. "Cat's in the sunlight! Couldn't you see?" Ms. Arkan shook her head. "You can't trust them." "I can't trust the sun?" Ms. Arkan jerked her head again. "It must be one of their mind tricks." "Even after our training?" "Never think you're completely safe from them!" Tarika pointed at Cat, who thought sunlight felt wonderful, but wondered if for nighters it was like nuclear radiation for humans, a slow and painful death.

 Tarika said, "You can't kill everyone who's in sunlight because they might be secret vampires!"

 Ms. Arkan said with a sneer, "We don't kill people." "You tried to kill Cat yesterday." "We couldn't risk her becoming what she is." Cat said, "Can nighters be in the sun?"

 Ms Arkan glanced at her, then frowned. "I never thought so." Tarika said, "Call Professor Medianoche for a second opinion." Ms. Arkan shook her head. "If he were wise, this problem would've disappeared fourteen years ago." A noise behind Cat made her turn. Mr. and Mrs. Chang, in robes and pajamas, were peering down the hall. Mr. Chang waggled a baseball bat near his shoulder. Ms. Chang waved her cell and shouted, "Leave now! Or I call the police!"

 Ms. Arkan squinted at them. "And why haven't you called already?"

 Because they can't let anyone know who's in the basement, Cat thought. Did the Arkans want the police involved? She shouted, "Call them! Now!" Without hesitating, Mrs. Chang began punching buttons. Ms. Arkan said, "Wait! We'll deal." Cat said, "Don't call." As Mrs. Chang cleared the phone number, Cat realized her voice had been backed with glamour. She stared at Ms. Arkan, focused on the need to be obeyed, and said, "Go. Away. Now."

 Ms. Arkan blinked. Then her eyes went wide. "What are you?" Too smart for my own good, she thought. "What do you mean?" "You play their mind tricks. You command their pawns. Yet you stand in the sun." "Pawns?"

 Ms. Arkan pointed. The Changs had marks like bug bites on their throats. Like Tarika's.

 Ms. Arkan caught Cat's glance and asked Tarika, "Who bit you?" Cat said, "Later. We should go." Ms. Arkan said, "What are you, Catalina Medianoche?" Cat shrugged, thinking, Good question.

 Ilya said, "She's in the sun. She talks instead of attacking--"

 "The nighters of Prague were rabid dogs, but a cunning wolf makes you think it's a pet." Ms. Arkan glanced at Cat. "A puppy."

 Cat said, "I'm trying to save--"

 The basement door opened a crack, then completely. The sunlight from the back door fell a foot short of its sill. Baldomero studied them from the safety of the shadows.

 Ms. Arkan snatched the bolt pistol from Tarika and spun toward him. As her finger tightened on the trigger, he said casually, "Drop it."

 She winced. The pistol twitched in her hand. "Fu--" "Now." The pistol fell. As Ilya stooped for it, Zoraida's voice came from behind Baldomero, "Stop there." Ilya froze as if he was playing a game of statues. Cat said, "Let them go. Please." Baldomero said, "They'll only kill more of us. You--" Zoraida stepped up beside him, putting a hand on his arm.

 "Baldomero. She's young." He shook his head. "Do you know how many I killed when I was born into the night?" Zoraida said patiently, "Seven." "And Granny Lupe was slain by that beast--" Baldomero pointed at

 Ms. Arkan. "How many did Lupe kill on the night she became herself?" "Twenty-three." "Yes! We're born in blood!"

 "You wanted me to learn control!" Cat said. "I did! Without killing anyone!"

 "Then you only learned half the lesson. The rest is killing with perfect control." He pointed at Tarika, Ilya, and Ms. Arkan. "Which of them would you like?"

 "I don't need to kill!" Zoraida said, "Let Tarika go. Who would believe her?" "Any of the Five Clans." "That doesn't matter. We can't stay here." "True." Baldomero glanced at the Changs. "Dress. Prepare the van.

 We leave immediately." "Yes, sir," Mrs. Chang said, and they hurried away. Cat said, "I thought--" "Quiet." Baldomero's glamour closed her lips tighter than a gag. She fought it, hating him for taking her freedom so casually. But she could only open her mouth if she did not try to speak. She looked at Tarika, then Ilya and Ms. Arkan, then thought of all the people in the world who did not know about nighters. Did three lives depend on her, or did millions?

 Baldomero said, "Alexandra Arkan. How did you find us?" "Fu--" "You can't fight me. Answer." "A tracer."

 "Where?" "On the motorcycle." "Who came with you?" "Erzsebet, Mihaly. Istvan." "Will they go if you order it?" Ms. Arkan shook her head. "Tell them to come in." "Ilya and I've been here too long. They've already gone." "Where?" "To Casa Medianoche." "Why?" "To report. To make a new plan." "How soon could they return?" "Fu--" "How soon!" "Two hours. Or less, if the clans agree quickly." Baldomero looked at Zoraida. "What do you think?" "Let the children go." "You grew soft living with that man." "What do we lose? Cat mastered the frenzy. You know what it means to be fond of lesser creatures."

 "No one should expect kindness from me."

 Zoraida smiled. "But they can receive it from you, nephew. I've seen you choose kindness."

 He shrugged and turned to Cat. "Sorry, Miracle. She's right. If I hadn't been so mad at the thought these killers would escape--" He turned to Tarika. "Go to the professor if you want to be believed. Go to the police if you don't. Go home and tell no one if you want to be safe. Now, go!"

 Tarika looked at Cat. "Should--"

 Cat hugged her. She tried to tell Tarika how much she loved her, but Baldomero's last command still bound her. She looked at him and pointed at her mouth.

 He nodded. "Cat. Be free of all I've commanded."

 She wanted to scream and tell him to never put limits on anyone again. She saw Ilya, crouching awkwardly, only able to show his fear with his eyes, and Tarika, waiting for her instead of running to safety. She made herself say, "Thanks, Baldomero," and pushed Tarika toward the door. "Luck, Tee."

 "Luck, Cat." Tarika whirled and ran into the alley. Listening to her footsteps, Cat thought, One safe. She looked at Ilya and his mother. Two to go.

 Baldomero said, "Close the door." "Let the Arkans go. If we're leaving--" "That's among the things we'll discuss. Close the door." Cat hesitated, warm in the early morning sunlight, then shut the door.

 "You are a miracle," Baldomero said. "You didn't kill your friend." Cat nodded. "I didn't start with her." "Who, then? I commanded--" "You said, 'no person.'"

 "If not a person--" "I went through the fridge. Soy milk helps." He stared in amazement and disgust. "You drank their swill?" "Yes! To keep from killing." He shook his head. "You cheated. Cleverly, but--" Zoraida said, "You saw. She fed and didn't kill. That's the point." "No!" Baldomero shouted. As Zoraida's eyes narrowed, he said more quietly, "We learn control so we can be just like them. We learn to kill from choice, not need." He pointed at Ms. Arkan. "Come here."

 "Mother!" Ilya gasped as Ms. Arkan lurched forward, glaring at Baldomero.

 Zoraida asked Baldomero, "What do you think you're doing?"

 Baldomero shook his head. Cat heard his glamour as he told Zoraida, "Keep the boy quiet." Zoraida stared at Ilya, and Ilya grew still.

 Baldomero smiled at Ms. Arkan. "You must have dreamed of this day. Did you quiver when you thought of your last kiss?"

 Zoraida said, "Why toy with her?"

 "Did Ysabel die mercifully? Did Lupe? Shouldn't they suffer as we do?"

 "Baldomero!" Cat said. "Please--" "Don't feel left out, Miracle. You'll feed, too." "If you let her go, they'll know they're wrong about us." "They'll only know they can fool us. Some problems can only be eliminated." He pointed at Ilya. "Drink from him. Learn the second half of your lesson."

 Cat shook her head.

 Baldomero glanced at Ms. Arkan. "How many of our kind have you killed?"

 She sneered. "At least one too few." "How many!" Her face calmed as his glamour took hold. "Forty-seven confirmed." "And suspected?" "A hundred, maybe two." "Why don't you know?" "No one wanted to dig through a village's ashes." Baldomero looked at Cat to be sure she had heard, then turned to

 Ilya. "How many have you killed, boy?" Ilya said numbly, "In Prague, three. In Budapest, one. In Paris, maybe one that fell in the Seine." Baldomero looked back at Cat. "You hear? When we call it war, we use the word that fits best." He jerked his chin toward Ilya. "War always has spoils for the victors. Drink, Catalina."

 She shook her head. "Even in your squeamishness, you're as willful as any of us. Drink!" With his command, she snapped her head toward Ilya. His gaze darted about the room, but his body stayed still. As she stepped forward, Cat said, "Baldomero! Make me do this, and I'll hate you. Totally hate you."

 He touched her cheek lightly. "No, Miracle. You'll thank me. The first steps are hardest. But soon you'll run to every chance to feast."

 No! she screamed in her mind, but her feet did not hear. Taking another step toward Ilya, she said, "Mama. Let Ilya go. Please."

 Zoraida shook her head. "It's not my choice. When he orders--" Cat's third step brought her so close to Ilya that they could embrace. Cat said, "It's not necessary! You're just doing this because you can!"

 Baldomero shook his head. "Because I love you, Catalina. Because I'll do all I can to help you be all you might be. Observe, then obey."

 He put his arms around Ms. Arkan. She flinched at his touch and turned her face toward Ilya, and they looked helplessly at each other. Baldomero took Ms. Arkan's jaw in his hand and turned her head toward him, though her eyes stayed on her son.

 Baldomero said, "Draw your prey close."

 As he pulled Ms. Arkan into his embrace, Cat thought, This is wrong! but her arms reached for Ilya.

 He gasped, and Cat wondered if he was trying not to sob, or if her traitorous arms were squeezing him too tightly. She thought, If all I can do is end this quickly, I should. For Ilya's sake.

 Baldomero smiled, baring long teeth. "And feed." He sank his fangs into Ms. Arkan's throat. And Cat plunged her mouth toward Ilya's neck. 

 Chapter Ten

 : Things Done Under the Sun

 As her lips came near his skin, she smelled him, sweaty with fear and exercise, a hint of ginger on his breath and peppermint in his hair. Her canines extended as quickly as springblade knives. Her gums burned as if her teeth would prefer to grow slowly with her hunger, but they could be unsheathed in an instant when she needed them.

 Or maybe they burned because the demand they obeyed was Baldomero's, not hers.

 This is wrong! filled her mind. She wasn't hungry. She wasn't protecting herself or anyone else. Each killing a nighter committed only made humans work harder to kill them. Killing was not their survival. Killing was their doom.

 But she could not fight Baldomero. She could not speak to him. His command was simple: Feed.

 Her teeth were an inch from Ilya's throat when something whispered,

 Be free!

 She jerked her head up. In the doorway to the basement, her mother watched her. In the hall, Baldomero drank from Ms. Arkan's neck. He glanced up, then lifted his mouth. Blood trickled from the punctures in Ms. Arkan's skin. Her pupils rolled as she hung limp in his arms. Frowning at Cat, Baldomero said, "I ordered--"

 "No!"

 "Drink!" His amber eyes were unblinking, as cold as ice on the highway, as intent as a wolf's hungry gaze.

 But his words were only a foolish wish. Cat shook her head, amazed that she could refuse him.

 His eyes widened. "Now." "No." He glanced at Zoraida. "How can she disobey?" Zoraida smiled. "She is herself." He nodded, then told Cat, "Perhaps the sight of feasting will bring your thirst." He pulled Ms. Arkan closer to him. Ilya managed to grunt, "Muh!" Cat said with all the force she could gather, "Baldomero! Don't!" His eyebrows rose. "Don't command me, Catalina. Some willfulness amuses me, but don't make me show you who rules the night folk." He glanced at Zoraida. "Drink from the boy." She said, "Baldomero, listen to--" "Drink!" Zoraida flinched, then seized the frame of the basement door. Her eyes held Cat's gaze. She said, "I can't--" Then she gasped, and her fangs extended a quarter-inch as she stepped forward.

 Cat grabbed Ilya in one arm, picking him up as easily as she had picked up Tarika, leaped to the back door, and yanked it so hard it tore from its hinges. Sunlight streamed in, bathing her in its uncomfortable heat.

 Bathing Baldomero, too. He screamed and stumbled back into Zoraida's arms.

 Cat shoved Ilya outside, jumped to Ms. Arkan's side, tore her from Baldomero's grip, and leaped again with Ms. Arkan in her arms, through the door, over a porch, and onto a cement walk.

 Ilya was staring at her. She wanted to stare at herself, too.

 But sunlight did not make them safe. "Come on!" she told Ilya, throwing Ms. Arkan over her shoulder. They ran into the alley, where Ms. Arkan squirmed and demanded, "Put me down! Now!"

 Cat was tempted to drop her on the sun-baked dirt, but she lowered her onto her feet.

 Ilya put his hand on Ms. Arkan's arm. "Mother? Are you all right?" "Of course." Ms. Arkan stroked the side of his head. "Are you?" "Cat didn't bite me. But you--" "A little blood. It's nothing."

 The bites on Ms. Arkan's throat had stopped bleeding. How long had Baldomero fed? Maybe a few seconds.

 Ms. Arkan turned to Cat. "What's your game?" "She saved us!" Ilya said. Ms. Arkan nodded at Cat. "No, not a puppy. A most cunning wolf." Cat said, "I just want everyone to stop fighting." Ms. Arkan smiled. "So do I. Help us exterminate your family, and

 I'll believe you." Cat jerked her head as the B&B's garage door opened. A large white

 SUV with dark windows drove out. Mrs. Chang was at the wheel. Cat couldn't see anyone else inside. The SUV went slowly down the alley, turned, and disappeared into the traffic.

 What now? she wondered. The de la Sombras were gone. The Medianoches wanted her dead.

 Ilya was watching her. She snapped, "What?"

 "Thank you," he answered, so simply that even though her life was ruined forever, she was sorry for being angry at him.

 Before she could decide what to say, Ms. Arkan ran back toward the B&B. "Ilya! Come!"

 He told Cat, "I must go."

 Ms. Arkan hopped onto Baldomero's bike and began checking the controls. Cat shouted, "That's not yours!"

 Ms. Arkan laughed. "It's not even a down payment on what I'm owed! Ilya! Now!"

 He hesitated. "Cat? I can't be on your side. But I'm not against you." Something thick in her throat wouldn't let her speak. She nodded. Ms. Arkan gunned the engine and rode up to them. Ilya gave Cat a last look. She wanted to say it was okay, but she couldn't. As he hopped on behind his mother, Ms. Arkan told Cat, "You didn't kill me. I didn't kill you. You would say we're square now, yes?" "What I would say are words I'm not supposed to call adults." Ms. Arkan grinned and jerked the throttle. Ilya watched Cat over his shoulder as he and his mother sped away. When they were gone, Cat put her hands in her hoodie. She had her cell. She could call her father, but what could she say? She was half a creature of the night, half of the day. She should belong to both, but she belonged to neither.

 She stuffed the cell back in her pocket, walked up the back steps of the B&B, and knocked. Mr. Chang looked out, frowned at her in her stained dress and torn hoodie, and said with mild confusion and distaste, "Yes? What do you want?"

 He didn't remember her. Either Baldomero's glamouring had worn off, or this was part of it. Cat said, "If you ever think there's something weird going on, call Valentin Medianoche. He's listed. Medianoche, okay?"

 Mr. Chang said, "If this is some religious thing, we're not interested. Sorry." The door closed.

 Cat shrugged and walked away. The sun was too hot on her skin. She pulled up her hood and stuffed her hands in her pockets. If she wanted to walk in daylight often, she would have to get a burka or learn how to be a raven or a wolf. But if she did that, she couldn't think.

 Not being able to think would be perfect right now. She thought, Be a wolf! Be a wolf, and don't think about anything!

 But she stayed a girl in torn, filthy clothes who had nowhere to go.

 Anyone from Casa Medianoche or Arkan Exterminators would come from the southeast, so she walked west. That was smart. Keep the sun at her back. In the afternoon, she could wrap something over her face or rest in the shade until sunset.

 But where should she go? Turn south for Mexico? Or Central America and into South America? All the way to Tierra del Fuego? Sneak onto a ship and go to Antarctica? How sensitive to temperature was she? Could she swim to the South Pole, then decide what to do? Wouldn't it be good to get as far from people as she could?

 She kept walking west. If she went to Los Angeles, she could do stunts in Hollywood or get a job in a circus. If she needed blood, she could bribe someone at a blood bank or pay street people for their blood.

 But she didn't have an ID. How could a fourteen-year-old get a job? She could glamour someone to act as her parent. But if she did, every time she looked at them, she would feel like a slaveowner. People around her were walking and bicycling and driving, heading to work or school. Though she looked like she had been swimming in a dumpster, no one noticed her. The don't-notice glamour worked even if she didn't think about it.

 Were nighters responsible for stories about ghosts as well as vampires and werewolves? Would she spend the rest of her life taking what she wanted and being forgotten as soon as she was gone? Could she find nighters and live with them? Or when she left her mother and Baldomero, had she cut herself off from her own kind?

 But they weren't her kind. She was the only nighter who walked in sunlight.

 Her cell vibrated. She checked the screen, clicked, and said, "Tee." "Cat! You're okay?" "As homeless vampires go, yeah. I could use a pity party." "Postpone it. I saw your dad."

 Cat glanced around for hidden snipers, then felt foolish. "And?" "You don't have to be homeless." "Oh." "Cat? Did you hear me?"

 "You trust him?" "You don't?" "Remember the trying to kill me part? I'm supposed to go home like it's all okay?" "Remember the turning into a vampire part?" "I'll never trust him." "He'll have some issues too, y'know." "What did he say?" "You know how he is." Cat nodded. She should say something into the phone. All she could think was what an unfeeling monster her father was. Tarika added, "He got real quiet, so I started to go. Then he said,

 'Tell her I thought I'd lost her forever. I couldn't bear that twice.'" It was hard to see the sidewalk. Cat stopped still. Tarika said, "Still there?" Cat nodded and touched the corners of her eyes.

 "Kind of need words if you're still there, Cat." "Kind of crying, Tee." "Kind of okay, Cat." "Not a trick?"

 "He gets an Oscar if it is." "And I get dead. Not the special effects kind." "I told him about what you ate and being in the sun and not killing me. He looked, like, relieved and sad and worried, all at the same time --"

 "Shit." "What!" "Still crying, Tee." "Still cool, Cat." She breathed deeply, then said, "Tell him I'll come home." "The glad." "The ditto." "Call me when things settle down?" "In a couple of centuries?" "Or this afternoon." "Sure. Tee?" "Yeah?" "Thanks." "For what? I'm just the messenger." "For, you know, the being you." Tarika laughed. "Like that's tough. Get home, chica." Cat pocketed her cell and wiped her eyes. Then she turned and started walking home. The sun was hot on her face, but she didn't care. *

 Walking was tiring. Knowing she was going home made tired feel good. Walking was so wonderfully boringly normal. It would be nice to get home and have something to drink. What could be more normal than--

 Oh. She grabbed her cell and hit callback. Tarika said, "That was fast." "Not home yet." "Girl--" "I need some soy milk or something." "Now?" "I'm good till I get home." "For sure?"

 "For sure," Cat said, hoping she was right.

 "No worries. I left a carton from my stash. Can you get by on soy milk?"

 "I don't know. It only reduces the thirst. I think I can live with that now."

 "If you need to drink--" "Not making that a habit, Tee." "Looking for alternatives could be fun, y'know. Testing new foods and recipes to see what works best--" "Not meaning to undo all the I'm-so-glad-you're-my-best-friend,

 Tee, but you can be really weird." "Waiting for the that's-what-you-like-about-me." "Keep waiting." "Because?" "It's one of the things I like about you." "Ex! E-mail the list, I'll put it on my blog, and all the jealous loser boys will say we're so gay." "Good plan. Thanks for getting Dad some disgusting bean juice." "You'll start to like it." "And monkeys will fly out--" "You'll see. Are you avoiding going home?" "A little." "Walk on, girl." Tarika clicked off. Cat shrugged and obeyed. 

 Chapter Eleven

 : A History Lesson

 As she walked up to Casa Medianoche, she scanned the bushes and trees and windows for signs of hidden assassins, then thought, Why am I afraid? They wouldn't shoot me outside. It would be hard to explain to the neighbors.

 Her father, in jeans and a black turtleneck shirt, was waiting on the porch. She thought something was strange, then knew what. In the past, whenever he waited outside, it was night, and Granny Lupe kept him company. How was Mama doing? Would Cat ever know?

 Her father nodded to her. "Hey, kid." He wasn't wearing a blanket over his legs. That was normal. He only wore a blanket when it was cold. Or when he was hiding a pistol.

 She couldn't tell what hurt worse, knowing she did not trust him or knowing he knew she did not trust him. She said as casually as she could, "Hey, Dad."

 He held up a glass of white liquid. "Disgusting bean juice?" She smiled in spite of herself. "Tee called you back?" He nodded. "She's all right." "Yeah," Cat said, thinking, Too bad you didn't have a daughter like her.

 She took the glass. As she looked at it, he said, "Want me to taste it?"

 She glanced at him. He held up both hands. "Sorry. That didn't work with the birthday wine. No reason it would work now. If it helps, Tee brought an unopened carton."

 Cat thought, So if there's anything in it, you added it? And you can't say you didn't add anything because saying that would mean we both know the trust thing is dead forever.

 Then she thought, He knows I could glamour him now. He knows I'm faster and stronger than him. Maybe the trust thing is only dead for a while.

 Or maybe he thinks I'm so dangerous it's worth risking his life to kill me. Guess there's one way to know.

 She drank. Soy milk tasted a little better than before, maybe because it was a different brand, maybe because she was getting used to the taste. With the first swallow, she felt stronger. She wanted to chug it, but she wasn't starving. Part of controlling thirst had to be learning to live with being thirsty. As she set the empty glass down, her father said, "You bit Tarika."

 "I didn't kill--" "Not my point, Cat." "I might need blood now and then." "If so, you'll get it. Also not my point." "Oh. Which is?" "You bit her. So you could've made her tell me anything." Cat stepped back, looking again for hidden people with bolt guns. "Cat, it's okay," he said. "She told me you bit her. If she'd wanted to trick me, she would've said it was Baldomero or Zoraida." "Oh." Cat studied him, then said, "We have some trust issues, huh?" "In your place, I'd have plenty. Don't sweat it." "So Tee telling the truth makes you trust me?" He glanced away. "If you were as cunning as your mother, you might think that one true detail would make me trust you." She blinked at him. "So you don't trust me?" "No, Cat. I trust you. That's just not why. It'll convince Olujimi and

 Auntie Fong, but it didn't convince me." "So what did?" He shook his head. "Nothing." "So you don't--"

 "Trust is trust, kid. For fourteen years, I couldn't trust you. Not completely. The result was I nearly killed the person I love most. Now I've got a second chance. From here on, I'll just trust you because I trust you. And maybe, someday, even though I'm a complete idiot, if I'm lucky, you'll be able to--"

 She threw her arms around him. His shoulders stiffened, but she held on tight, like he was a shapeshifter that she had to hold until he became himself. After a moment, he patted her back awkwardly. Then his arms settled around her, so very strong, so very gentle. She realized she was sobbing. When he squeezed her, she realized she wasn't the only one.

 After a minute or five, he let go of her. "Okay for now?"

 "Okay for now," she agreed. "Can I quote the 'complete idiot' part for blackmail?"

 "Did you tape it?" "No." "Hearsay." "Still kind of hard on your rep." "It might be worth a get-out-of-jail-free card." "Or two?"

 "Fatherly guilt gets trumped by fatherly responsibility. It's in the handbook." "Oh."

 "But today, you get just about anything you want." "Like the whole truth?" "Whole?" She nodded.

 He looked at his hands, then at her. "There's a lot of it." "Expecting that." "Now?" She looked at her filthy clothes. "After I change?"

 "I'll be in the study." He opened the door for her, then added, "I'm glad you're back, kid."

 "Likewise, Dad."

 As soon as she stepped inside, Casa Medianoche felt too big, sounded too empty, smelled too dusty and lifeless and stale. She had never heard Granny Lupe during the day, but she had always known Lupe was in the basement, ready to wake and hear any story she had to tell. She wished what she had believed was true, that she was a normal girl with an odd father and an eccentric grandmother in a decrepit old house that was too big, but was home.

 It was strange to see Casa Medianoche as it must look to strangers. Tarika's home was small and cozy. Casa Medianoche was too big for two people. Even with many rooms closed because they were empty and more closed because they were full of books and boxes, Cat and her father and Granny Lupe had barely been able to keep the place clean.

 As Professor M took the elevator up, Cat went to the back of the house. The parlor door was closed. She thought of Aunt Ysabel and wondered if the floor was stained, then walked faster. She didn't want to ask who cleaned it.

 She ran up the stairs and grabbed a change of clothes. She only wanted to shower and feel clean, but she paused in the doorway and studied her room. The paint was dingy. The windows were drafty. It was the room of a girl who had looked at her mother's painting over her bed and seen a beautiful woman. Now she only saw a monster.

 By the door were photos of her day-after-her-birthday dinners, when the Medianoches and the de la Sombras had gone and her father took Cat and Tarika out for a meal that was "just them." For eight years, he had taken pictures of Cat and Tarika sitting at restaurant tables, at Magpies Pizza, at Old Tucson Studios, at the OK Cafe in Tombstone, at Elvira's in Nogales listening to mariachis, at the Casbah near the University sitting on cushions in a room like a tent. In every picture, she and Tarika had their arms around each other. Where would he have taken their picture today? She had thought "just them" meant just her and Tarika. But seeing how every picture was composed so she and Tarika had the same big grins, she realized the photographer is always part of the picture.

 She showered until the hot water ran out, then dressed in purple high-tops, black jeans, and a purple long-sleeved T-shirt. When she went to the study, her father was typing. Without looking up, he said, "One more paragraph?"

 "The cool."

 She looked around the room she had taken for granted. Shelves of ancient books covered most of the walls. For as long as she could remember, she had come in here two or three times a day to put away or fetch books her father couldn't reach. She had never wondered what they were about. She had never thought they might be about her in some way. She looked at the spines. Few had titles, and those were faded or in strange alphabets.

 Over the fireplace was the painting of Senor Ricardo de Medianoche. On his gloved fist perched a hawk. It could have been a nighter. Did he know? The hawk and Senor Ricardo were enigmas. Cat couldn't tell which one looked fiercer.

 The only other furnishing was a mirror as big as a door. She had always loved its frame: A brass snake coiled around the oval glass to swallow its tail. She assumed that was why her father kept it. In its smoky glass, everything seemed dim and distorted.

 "Vampires hate mirrors!" She jumped in front of it. A sickly gray ghost stared back at her. "Okay, I know why they hate this one."

 "Oh?"

 "Makes your butt look ginormous." She frowned at her father in the dark mirror. "So the stuff about vampires and mirrors isn't true?"

 "Depends on whether the nighter wants to hide. Your mother used mirrors like any-- Never mind. You see yourself, right?"

 "As well as I ever could in this."

 "It was state of the art in Ricardo's day. Ancient mirrors were usually small. Someday we'll sell that to a museum, and you can go to any university you want."

 "What?" Cat whirled to face him. "No way!"

 "Huh. I thought we were going to talk about nighters, but the father in me says your education is more important."

 "I mean you can't sell that mirror. You keep selling things like they don't matter."

 "This house is full of the past, Cat. We need to look to the future." "And get rid of everything?"

 "Why not? Buy a beach hut in Fiji, and the only thing we'll worry about is the strength of our sun block."

 "I might have to worry about that anyway." "So we'll move to Vancouver Island. I look great in a trench coat." Cat frowned. "Why're you talking about moving?" He tapped his fingers on his arm rest, then said, "They can find you here." "Baldomero and Mama?" "And every nighter that serves them. They'll do anything to get you back." "You're sure?" "In their place, I would." "I didn't tell you what happened after Tee left." "You don't need to. Xandra called. I talked to Ilya, too." "Baldomero will hate me." "Not after he's calmed down. And your mother will always want you back." She didn't want to think about the de la Sombras now. "So tell me about Senor Ricardo." He father nodded. "He appears in history in 1204 at the sack of

 Constantinople. You know about the Fourth Crusade? The Crusaders decided fighting Muslims was too hard, so they attacked the nearest Christians instead. In Constantinople, Ricardo joined the Night Council, a secret band of soldiers and scientists. Many of them had seen nighters feast on the wounded on battlefields. They thought all wars were promoted by nighters, so when every nighter was dead, the world would finally have peace."

 "Do you think that?"

 "I think they underestimated the human capacity to get mad and act stupid, but there's no question wars are started by people who want power. Back to Ricardo?"

 Cat nodded.

 "Sometime later in Spain, he got his title: el Senor de Medianoche. But a few years after that, he was the lord of a castle in Languedoc in the south of France, and he's called le Sieur du Chateau du Minuit. His wife's family were Cathars, pacifist Christians considered heretics by the Catholic church."

 Cat held up a hand. "Professor M! Professor M! I have a question!" "Is someone having fun?" She nodded. "Good. What?"

 "Do crosses protect people from nighters?" "Sometimes, but not because nighters are afraid of religious symbols. It's just tribalism--a Christian nighter would rather feed on a heretic, but hungry nighters take what they can get. May we continue, Senorita Medianoche?"

 Cat nodded.

 "Pope Innocent the Third said Catholics who killed Cathars could keep their land. Before attacking one village, a Crusader asked a papal delegate how to tell the difference between Cathars and Catholics there. The delegate said, 'Kill them all. Surely the Lord knows which are his.' No one knows how many Cathars were slaughtered. The delegate estimated twenty thousand.

 "Castle Midnight was plundered and burned. History says Ricardo died protecting Cathars, but the Night Councilors have their own story. They say he thought it was possible to make peace with nighters, so he arranged a secret meeting, but the nighters killed him."

 The professor reached into his breast pocket. "The rest of your birthday present." He tossed something small that glistened in the air.

 His silver ring with the turquoise stone landed in her palm. She glanced at the mirror's frame: it was also a snake biting its tail.

 "The Worm Ouroboros," her father said. "'Worm' is an old word for snake or dragon. 'Ouroboros' means tail-eater. It's a symbol of eternity. That's how long the Night Council is prepared to fight nighters."

 Cat looked at the portrait of Ricardo. The blue-green ring was on the little finger of his right hand. She tried it on her ring finger, then put it on her middle one. "What do you think?"

 "The father's handbook says I should say that's a rude gesture that's never called for. But it'll look great." His voice grew quieter and grimmer. "The heads of the Five Clans are meeting this afternoon."

 "Is that the Night Council?"

 "What's left of it. The Medianoches, the Udofias, the Fongs, the Arkans, and the al-Rahmans."

 "That's why Uncle Olujimi, Auntie Fong, and Ms. Arkan have rings like this?"

 Professor M nodded. "Mind pointing that the other way?" "Oops!" She closed her hand. "Who's the head of the al-Rahmans?" "Saeed al-Rahman. His mother was the First of their family, but she died last year--of old age, not nighters. I haven't met him." Cat nodded. "Where do nighters come from?" "No one knows. Some say the first cities were built so nighters would never go hungry. Some say the Night Council began in the time of the Pharaohs."

 "You don't?"

 "I think humans fought nighters everywhere, and the Night Council came later, when different groups started working together. It's a chicken or egg question. What matters is the Ouroboros War has been fought for as long as anyone knows."

 "What about nighter prophecies?" He squinted at her. "Are there any?" Cat nodded. "'One born between the worlds will lead the folk to glory.'" Professor M's eyes widened. Then he looked out the window and put the tips of his fingers together. "Keep that secret. Prophecies are just wishful thinking, but some of us are superstitious. So far as the clans are concerned, what matters is you haven't killed anyone and you're not about to."

 Cat thought, Is he really so sure I can control it? Wish I was. "What if soy milk stops helping me?"

 "Then we'll get you blood until we find a solution. Olujimi will have a ball hunting the common elements in soy milk and blood. You'll be okay, kid."

 "If there's hope for me--" Cat hesitated. "Is there hope for other nighters?" "Yeah." "You're half-human. They're not."

 "But if they don't have to drink blood--" "You think that's all it's about?" "Sure. Survival." He shook his head. "Power. Nighters won't sign up for a feeding program. They want to rule us." "You don't know that." "You don't think Baldomero loves power?" "It's not just him." "So long as he rules, it is." "Could we convince the others to leave him?" "You don't disobey when mind-control's involved." "I did." She remembered the voice that had whispered, Be free! "I think Mama helped." Her father's eyes narrowed like arrow slits in a castle wall. "How?" She hesitated. How could Mama have freed her from Baldomero when she couldn't free herself? "I don't know. But I think she did something."

 Professor M shook his head. "Zoraida would love to rule in his place. You'd be useful to her if she turns against him."

 "You don't know that." "I know what happens if you think a nighter loves you."

 Cat wanted to ask about her parents' marriage, but that would be like jabbing a wound with a stick. She asked the first question that seemed safe: "Why don't the Five Clans tell people about nighters?"

 "Like public service announcements?" She nodded. "People are better off thinking they've met a crazy person than a nighter. They're more likely to fight back if they think they've got a chance."

 "Do they have a chance? If nighters do the mind-control thing--"

 "Few nighters are as powerful as Baldomero and Zoraida. And some humans are resistant to hypnotism."

 "How do you know?"

 "We interview survivors. We study our failures. It explains--" He looked out the window. "A lot."

 She saw what he thought: either he had been hypnotized by Zoraida, or he had been an idiot. Maybe he was right. Maybe her mother had glamoured him to breed a nighter who could walk in daylight.

 She said, "Dad?"

 He glanced back at her. "Olujimi and Auntie Fong are patrolling nearby. Mind if I call them in? Some questions you might prefer to ask them."

 She thought, Some questions you might prefer I asked anyone else. She said, "I wouldn't prefer asking Auntie Fong anything."

 "Cut her all the slack you can, kid. Thanks to nighters, she's buried a father, a sister, a husband, a daughter, two sons, three cousins, and a whole lot of friends." He took out his cell, clicked it, and said, "Lunch time. Come on back."

 As he put it away, Cat said,"Why do people in the clans have kids? If everyone's going to die fighting--"

 "You wishing you hadn't been born?" "If I'd been human, what would've happened?" "Each clan has its customs. Medianoches are told on their eighteenth birthday. You would've been free to choose the life you wanted." "Did you feel free to choose?" He closed his eyes. "Sometimes I wish I had a stupid daughter. Yeah, the pressure is on to join the war. But don't think the clans are for breeding soldiers. We all tell ourselves the war will end before our kids are grown."

 Before she could decide how to answer that, she heard the front door open. Her father yanked open a desk drawer and set his hand on a bolt pistol. Then Uncle Olujimi called from downstairs, "Didn't someone say lunch was ready!" Professor M asked Cat, "Want to give 'em a hand? Soup's in the fridge." When she nodded, he called, "Help's coming!" Then he looked at Cat. "They wouldn't be here if they weren't on your side."

 She thought, Or if they thought you were wrong, so they should solve the problem themselves.

 "Got it," she said, and went into the hall. 

 Chapter Twelve

 : Lunch

 Looking down from the stair landing, she thought Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong were dressed for a party. He wore a tan suit with a dark brown T-shirt. She wore matching blue trousers and jacket with a white silk blouse. Cat sniffed. Something smelled like bolt guns. She squinted. Olujimi had a shoulder holster. Anything could be in Auntie Fong's shoulder bag.

 Cat pointed out the window. "Sun."

 Olujimi grinned. "Looks very nice on you, Tiger. But telling us you're a nighter who likes the sun isn't helpful."

 Auntie Fong said, "What matters is you behaved like a--" She hesitated. "Your father spoke with you?"

 Cat nodded. "Five clans, killing nighters, got it."

 Auntie Fong's eyes narrowed. "You are your father's daughter. Therefore we're prepared to conditionally--"

 Olujimi said, "Unconditionally. If I get a hug."

 Auntie Fong said, "We're prepared to accept that the misfortune of your birth does not change your position in your family."

 Olujimi said, "For a few days, if you say boo, everyone'll wet themselves. But what we're trying to say is-- Well, about last night, it was a natural misunderstanding, so we're just glad--"

 Cat said, "Do you guys want soup or not?"

 Olujimi smiled. Auntie Fong said, "Yes, dear. We would like that very much."

 Cat came down the stairs. Before anyone could try to hug her, she said, "No one moved the kitchen, did they?"

 Olujimi frowned. "Not that I heard." "Good." She walked past them and led them down the hall. "Is it your father's lentil soup?" Auntie Fong said. "I love that." Olujimi said, "Never enough garlic." Auntie Fong said, "You would say that if it was all cloves and one lentil." "You have to have a lentil," Olujimi said. "For flavor." Cat said, "What's with nighters and garlic?" Olujimi glanced at her. "Oh." Cat said, "Look, I am what I am, so everybody get over it, okay?"

 Auntie Fong said, "You're a Medianoche, and therefore you triumphed over the beast within you."

 Cat said, "I'm a Medianoche, a de la Sombra, a human, and a nighter, and I'm not taking sides."

 "More fool you, child!" said Auntie Fong. "If you don't take a side, a side will take you. When you saved your friend, you showed what you are. Don't let a misguided sentiment--"

 Olujimi said, "Also not helpful." He looked at Cat. "No one wants you to deny what you are."

 Auntie Fong said, "Speak for yourself, Olujimi."

 As they stepped into the kitchen, Olujimi said, "Tiger, I don't want you to deny what you are. But if you romanticize a nighter just because she's your mother--"

 Cat yanked open the refrigerator and pulled out the soup pot so quickly the lid almost fell off. "It's Dad's lentil soup. So what's the deal with garlic?"

 Olujimi and Auntie Fong looked at each other. Olujimi said, "Confuses their sense of smell. Might dull it, a little."

 "Huh." Cat put the pot on the stove, turned it to medium-high, lifted the lid, and inhaled deeply. It smelled like her favorite: lentils, black pepper, serrano pepper, curry, cumin, potatoes, carrots, spinach, and zucchini. But something was different. She glanced at the spice rack. Vegetable bouillon. Dad hadn't used chicken stock. He must've been talking to Tarika, and she mentioned--

 He had heard from Tarika, and he hadn't been able to do anything, so he had made Cat's favorite soup. And because Tarika said dead animals made Cat queasy now, he used vegetable bouillon.

 Olujimi said, "Cat? Tiger?" Auntie Fong said, "Does the odor trouble you?" Cat shook her head. "Smells good." Olujimi said, "Even the garlic?" Cat nodded. "Maybe it dulls things. But it smells good." She looked at Olujimi. "Still want a hug?" "I always want a hug, gorgeous." They embraced. If her sense of smell was weaker, it did not keep her from recognizing bay rum in his after shave. She released him, and he stepped back, saying, "I'll never understand girls. I don't mind that, though."

 Cat looked at Auntie Fong. "I am what I am, Auntie."

 "I know, dear," she said. "I honor that." Then she lifted her arms. Her embrace was tentative, as if she was afraid Cat was fragile, but Cat knew Auntie Fong also was who she was.

 Olujimi took a multigrain baguette from the counter, found a bread knife and cutting board, and began slicing. Auntie Fong took silverware and napkins to the table near the window, then put the kettle on for tea. Cat stirred the soup. It smelled wonderful. It smelled even more wonderful because it meant she could live on other foods than soy milk and peanut butter.

 Unless something could smell good and still not satisfy her. She didn't want to think about that.

 When Olujimi got out the butter, it stank. Cat said, "Not for me." "Oh, Tiger. You loved butter. I don't suppose cheese--" Something started to rise in Cat's throat. "I'll find something else to love." "Olive oil? I don't see margarine--" "I'll try olive oil." "Tres chic, Tiger." He tapped his finger lightly against his chin. "Are nighters lactose intolerant?" "The de la Sombras had cake and hot chocolate on my birthdays." "Hmm. The degree of intolerance may vary. Or they may've forced themselves to eat for your sake. They have to be able to pass for human."

 Auntie Fong said, "That dessert could've been dairy free." Cat said, "Please say there's dairy-free ice cream." Olujimi said, "Soy ice cream. And rice. And amazing sorbet. For special people, I make mango sorbet. It's easy, and mm-licious! Perhaps this evening, special person?"

 Cat said, "I'm glad you're still Uncle Olujimi." "Not as much as I am, Tiger." Auntie Fong said, "We shall go to the grocer's and get as many desserts as you care to try." "Shopping!" Olujimi said. "Your years have brought you great wisdom." Auntie Fong nodded. "I vaguely remember being a young woman once. I have a notion we might also look for shoes." Olujimi said, "Careful. Too much, and she'll think you're buying her affection." Cat said, "And the wrong part of that is?" "Right," he said. "Because we need to find out how Cat reacts to, um, shoes now." "I'll sacrifice for science." Cat said, "Uh--" Olujimi squinted at her. "What?" "Dad said I should ask you guys about Mama." Auntie Fong said, "If we must speak of that vile--" Olujimi said, "Auntie, why don't you sit by the window with a cup of tea? I'll answer her questions." "I know when I'm being dismissed." "That's the point, Auntie." "Well, I'd much rather admire the birds that visit Tucson than listen to anything about that vicious--" "Auntie."

 She sighed and picked up her cup. "I go, I go, look how I go." Olujimi turned to Cat. "What do you want to know?" "Everything. I thought Mama died after I was born, like there was a mistake at the hospital, but all I knew was it was something no one talked about."

 "You weren't born at a hospital. You were born here at Casa Medianoche. There was a midwife. Later, we realized--" Olujimi shook his head. "I should back up. Val and Xandra Arkan were a couple."

 Cat held up her hand. "Does anyone date outside the Five Clans?"

 He smiled. "Never fear. You'll have complete freedom in your romantic life."

 Auntie Fong said, "Except--" Olujimi said, "Is that a cardinal, Auntie?" "Pyrrhuloxia, dear. I'll be quiet now." Olujimi said, "Val was doing the Professor Midnight show for public access television. Your mother sent him a fan letter, they e-mailed a few times, then agreed to meet for lunch. What he missed was that she suggested the Kon Tiki, which has no windows. Maybe she flew in through a bathroom window. The idea that nighters have to be invited is wishful thinking. After that, it never occurred to him that she might not be human. She was beautiful and clever and she liked him--" Olujimi shrugged. "And Val's not the brightest around women."

 Auntie Fong said, "To be fair, Olujimi, and do not expect me to be fair on this subject again, we were pleased that he found someone other than Alexandra Arkan. It never occurred to us that he could find someone worse--"

 "Done, Auntie," Olujimi said.

 "A Red-naped Sapsucker!" said Auntie Fong, looking back out the window.

 "Three months later, they married. Why Val didn't figure it out in the next seven months, well, that tells you how much he loved her."

 Cat said, "Um, does seven months mean nighters are different, or--"

 "No one asked," Olujimi said. "And continuing to be fair to Val, we keep the hours of the creatures we hunt. Zoraida told him she liked staying up to meet him when he came home. If he returned early, they would go to clubs and dance until dawn. He thought he'd found the perfect mate for someone in our trade." Cat nodded, imagining her father and mother dancing together, his face unscarred and smiling, her eyes flashing with joy. "When you were born, Tiger, Auntie and I were here. So was

 Baldomero. The midwife was under his glamour so she wouldn't notice anything unusual. But the birth was harder than expected, and your mother went into a deep coma. Baldomero didn't dare use his glamour on Val, Auntie, or me. With our training, we would know what he was. He had to let us think Zoraida was dead.

 "He said he would take her body for a traditional burial. He wanted to take you with him also, but Auntie insisted that since you couldn't bond with your mother, you should stay with your father. Val swore no one would take you from him, so Baldomero gave in. I doubt he had time to argue. Zoraida had lost a lot of blood. How he managed to save her, I'm glad to say I don't know.

 "We hired a nurse to help while we tried to figure out what to do. None of us were thinking about nighters. We built a fire in the den and put your crib there. Val would've been useless if he hadn't had to think about you, but because he did, he was watching over you constantly, pacing all the time, rarely pausing to sit or sleep. Once the nurse showed him what to do, her job consisted of making coffee. We drank a lot of coffee over the next three nights.

 "On the third, despite the caffeine, Auntie and I and the nurse fell asleep around midnight. Val must've dozed off, too. All he said is he woke and saw his dead wife in the room. She was drinking from your arm."

 Cat's eyes flicked wide. Olujimi frowned. "Tiger? If you don't want to hear the rest--"

 She made herself nod. "'Have to' beats 'want to'."

 "True. Val yelled at her to stop. Zoraida set you in your crib. There was blood on your arm and her lips. He grabbed a brand from the fire as she came at him, and he swung it, catching her sleeve. Her dress began to burn.

 "Nighters can't deal with fire. It overloads their senses, or maybe their senses are so acute-- Well. She screamed and hit him, knocking him across the room and into the wall. That's when I woke. I saw a burning woman go out the window. I saw the man I considered my brother, collapsed on the floor like a broken puppet. I heard you crying. It was--"

 "It wasn't my best night," Professor M said from the door. Cat whirled to face him, thinking, Poor Dad--

 Before anyone could speak, the professor said, "So, I'm in the hospital. Auntie and Olujimi are taking care of you--" Auntie Fong told Cat, "Everyone said you were a much easier child to care for than your father, dear." Professor M said, "I wake in intensive care, and Baldomero's at the foot of my bed, watching me. I can't say how, but I knew what he was as soon as I saw him. I think he wanted me to feel his power, to know how easily he could kill me, especially now that I was..." He glanced down at his legs, shook his head, then met her eyes. "Baldomero says Zoraida's dead, and he would gladly kill me while I'm helpless, but he has a problem. He doesn't know if you'll become a nighter or stay human. Till that happens, he offers a deal. Nighters will only kill humans in self-defense. In return, the Medianoches won't hunt them. Once a year, a nighter or two of his choice will visit you. And to make sure we keep our word, one of them will live with us." Professor M's lips tightened into a thin line, and Cat thought about what must have gone through his mind then, as he realized the woman he loved had been the worst of his enemies, and his daughter might be one also, and the price of learning the truth was letting a nighter live with him for years.

 "I agreed," he said simply, then studied Cat's face and added, "Some kids blame themselves for everything that goes wrong. What happened here is ancient history you have nothing to do with. Got it?"

 She nodded. "I'm good with blaming adults for everything wrong with the world."

 "Then I raised you right. Questions?" "When Mama attacked us, did she mean to?" "What people do matters more than what they mean." "But if it was the hunger, and she lost control--" "I play it over in my head ev-- Well, a lot. Maybe she was planning to carry you off and leave me sleeping, but she hadn't healed, and her hunger took her--" He shrugged. "She's a nighter. Either she's a stone cold killer or a mad one. Doesn't change what has to be done."

 "You're sure about what you saw?"

 "My dead wife with her fangs in our daughter's arm?" Professor M nodded. "Oh, yeah. I don't think a rattlesnake bit you and she was sucking out the venom. It may've been a nightmare, but it was real."

 Cat pulled her sleeves back and looked at them. "No scars." "Nighter bites heal clean." "Oh." "I wouldn't tell you if you didn't have to know."

 Cat nodded.

 "No one's going to ask you to kill your mother. But you might have to stand back when it happens."

 Could she watch someone send a spike into her mother's heart? She said, "Mama was drinking my blood," half as a question, half to make it real.

 Professor M nodded. "Babies don't have much to spare."

 Auntie Fong added, "She must've feared you would be competition. You are a threat to her, whether you're with them or us."

 Professor M said, "Cat's with us!" Auntie Fong glanced at Olujimi, then nodded. "Of course she is." Cat said, "But Mama loves me." Professor M said, "In her way, yes." Auntie Fong said, "Last night, she thought you would be useful. She may not love you so much now." "Not just last night. I always knew Granny Lupe loved me." "Remember their glamour," Olujimi said. "Wasn't glamour." "How can you know?" asked Auntie Fong. "Without training--" Cat stared at her. How could she be sure of anything about Zoraida de la Sombra? She had thought she knew Granny Lupe, but Granny Lupe was only a mask. Would Cat have to help half of her family kill the other half?

 Olujimi said, "Tiger, if it feels like we're piling on, say so. We'll back off."

 Professor M said, "As much as we can. A lot has to be decided today. You can deal?"

 Cat shrugged. "Lots of kids have mother issues."

 Professor M nodded. "That's my girl. So--" He wheeled his chair toward the stove. "Let's eat."

 The soup was as delicious as it smelled. After the first taste, Cat wondered if yesterday's Cat would've liked it as much as she did. Then she decided yesterday's Cat could worry about that.

 Olujimi said, "What's the verdict?"

 "Olive oil on bread is different," Cat said. "But I like it. The bread's ex. But the soup doesn't just taste ex. It makes me feel, like, stronger." She looked at her father. "Don't ask if it's like stronger or really stronger. It's stronger."

 He said, "Part of a parent's duty is to despair at the damage the young do to our language. Fortunately, English is tough."

 "Lentils aren't as high in protein as soy, but they're up there," Olujimi said. "Humans need a little protein and a lot of carbs. With nighters, the reverse may be true. I'd love to autopsy one."

 "Not volunteering," Cat said. He nodded. "And you won't be drafted."

 "No one's autopsied a nighter?"

 Auntie Fong said, "The circumstances are rarely conducive for bringing a body to a laboratory."

 Olujimi added, "And nighter tissue is volatile. Probably a factor in shape-changing. Getting blood and skin samples from you would be nice."

 "For you," Cat said. "It won't hurt." "I hate doctors who say it won't hurt." "It won't hurt a lot." "I can live with that." Cat got up for a second bowl of soup. "Why did Ms. Arkan use her own van to try to kill me?" "More of the Arkan way," Professor M said. "Reporting it stolen gives her deniability, but nighters and the clans both know who gets the credit."

 "Will she try again?" "Depends on the council meeting." "Should I worry?" He glanced at Olujimi and Auntie Fong. "I don't think so. Tell the truth, give everyone a big smile, and things'll be fine." "Not your best advice, Dad." "Then how about, get a nap? When you can't do anything else before a fight, rest." She thought, It'll be a fight? but she only said, "Do I need everyone on the council to vote for me? Ms. Arkan never will." Her father held her gaze, then nodded. "True. But you only need a majority." Cat glanced at Olujimi and Auntie Fong. Both were focusing on their tea. Were they avoiding her eyes? She had proven herself, hadn't she? The meeting was just a formality, wasn't it? She looked at her father. He said, "Nap, kid. You've had a long day, and it's not over yet."

 The thought of resting before a fight did not make her want to rest. She started to say she wasn't tired, then realized she was a little drunk with sleeplessness. Resting was smart. Getting away from people for a while was smarter. She nodded. "Sure."

 Heading down the hall, she heard her father call, "Rest well!" Olujimi added, "Shout if you need anything!" But all she heard from Auntie Fong was a question addressed to her father, "Can the two of you keep up this old house?" She wanted to stay for the answer, but an infinite number of questions needed answers. They all hung on the meeting of the Five Clans. Why should she worry? Even if Ms. Arkan and Mr. Rahman voted against her, Dad and Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong were on her side.

 She found herself walking faster as she neared her room. She wanted to lie on her bed and pull her purple blanket around her and not think about it being a present from Granny Lupe. She wanted to close her eyes and not think about anything until someone said it was time for the meeting.

 She ran up the last steps. With her hand on the door handle, she hesitated. The first thing she would see would be the portrait of Zoraida de la Sombra.

 Cat had other favorite places in the house. She could nap in any of them.

 But then her father would worry when he couldn't find her.

 She opened the door. The painting was just a painting. Better to sleep than to think about her mother. She fell onto her bed and thought, I have to help kill Mama and Baldomero and all the nighters, unless the Five Clans decide I'm some kind of scary freak nighter. Then what happens?

 She was toying with the necklace that Baldomero gave her. She pulled it off, wanting to throw it out the window or in the trash, or take a hammer to the locket and destroy it so no one would ever wonder what it was or who the monsters inside it were. But as she looked at it, she remembered that he gave it to her before he knew if she would become a nighter. If she had turned out to be human, she would still have the locket to remember her mother and cousin by.

 She clicked it open. Baldomero and Zoraida didn't look like monsters. They seemed to smile with secret knowledge, but it was knowledge Cat shared now. Was she more like them than like her father? She wanted to hate them, but all she could think was, They're monsters. And they love me. No way I'll get to sleep.

 Then she slept.

 And dreamt she was dancing, swirling through a windy, moonlit night, laughing with her mother and Baldomero and Tia Ysabel. 

 Chapter Thirteen

 : The Five Clans

 She woke to the sound of someone saying, "Cat?" Tarika stood by her bed with a big purple mug in her hand. "Bean juice?"

 Cat sat up. "Is everyone going to be afraid--" "Yes." Tarika shoved the mug at her. "Drink, and we'll relax." "I'm good. Nighters probably only feed every day or two." "Not the time to test that, Cat." She nodded and drank. Soy milk tasted even better as it became familiar. Did it make her feel stronger? She didn't think so, but maybe it was more noticeable when she needed to drink. She glanced at the clock. "You're skipping school?"

 "Like I never skipped school before." "Tee, you never skipped school before." Tarika shrugged. "Like I never thought about skipping school before." She sat on the edge of the bed. "I had to know how you were." "How did you get in?" "You know the tree by the back fence? Once you jump from it and dash across the yard, keeping low so no one sees you, the hard part's over. Shinnying up the back porches and onto the roof and up the tower and through your window after that? Easy." Tarika nodded. "Or you could get your jeans stuck in the tree, and while you're freeing them, Professor M could come on the back porch and yell, 'Hey, Tarika! Want to go up and see Cat?' It would've been rude to shinny then, though I was looking forward to it, because, you know, who gets to shinny every day? You're really good?"

 "Really good," Cat agreed, thinking, In the not-hungry sense, not the not-nervous one.

 "You're supposed to go downstairs once you've washed. What's the deal?"

 "It's about nighters." "Kind of guessed that much. And about you?" "Kind of yeah." "I'll tell how you saved me." "Dad would've said if you were supposed to. What did your folks say when you got home?" "It was weird. The house was empty, so I called Mama. She asked why I was calling from home instead of school. Baldomero must've glammed them."

 "What'd you say?"

 "That I wanted to see what skipping school was like. She said I'd better not decide to see what it was like twice." Tarika shook her head. "I'm just glad she wasn't glammed into forgetting she had a daughter." Tarika glanced at Cat. "What?"

 "I keep trying to think nighters aren't the total bad. But they kill and kidnap and mess with people's minds and--"

 Tarika said, "And it's still your mom and cousin."

 "Yeah." Cat glanced at the clock, sighed, stood, looked in the mirror, and smoothed her hair. "Okay, officially washed."

 Professor M waited in the upper hall. He looked at Tarika and said, "Might be best if you left by the back stairs."

 Cat said, "She knows like everything I do. And the clans know she's involved, right?"

 "Slightly involved." Tarika said, "Weird definition of slightly, Professor M." He shrugged. "Once is slightly. Twice is something I wouldn't wish on anyone." "Cat's involved, so I am." "Nothing dangerous will happen at the meeting, will it?" Cat said. "I don't want--" Tarika said, "Not entirely about what you want, Cat. I'm not leaving unless you throw me out." When her father nodded, Cat said, "You let her in so she could insist on staying!" He rolled into the elevator, then glanced at them. "Don't tell Auntie

 Fong." The elevator doors closed. Tarika said, "So I'm here for moral support? I can handle that." Cat grinned, but as Tarika grinned back, she thought, Not just moral support. To show everybody that even after last night, Tee trusts me. Is anyone sneakier than my dad?

 She stopped at the top of the stairs. Auntie Fong and a goateed Middle Eastern man in a dark blue suit were frowning up at them. As they came down, Auntie Fong told the man, "If you'll step into the dining room, we'll follow momentarily." As he left, she turned to Cat. "Shouldn't your friend be going now?"

 Professor M rolled up the hall. "Tarika's involved." "This is a matter for the families." "She's family."

 "She's a friend. Friends are not--" "To Cat, she's family. So she's mine." "She's a child." "She's two months older than Cat." "Catalina had no choice." Tarika said, "Like I had a choice last night?" Auntie Fong looked at her. "No, and I'm sorry for that. But you have a choice now." "To go play video games?" Tarika shook her head. "If you know about a problem, you have to find a solution." Auntie Fong looked at Cat. "Dear, any involvement in these matters could be dangerous. For your friend's sake--" Tarika said, "I'm here for my friend's sake! You're having a meeting to decide what happens to Cat, and she needs all the protection she can get. Even if it's just me."

 Auntie Fong shook her head. "You don't know what you're getting into."

 Professor M said, "Who does?"

 Auntie Fong shrugged. "It's the clan leader's call. But if this child is hurt--"

 "She's a target already. There comes a time when knowledge is more protection than ignorance."

 "I hope you're right, Val." Auntie Fong looked at Tarika. "Let's go inside."

 Entering the dining room was like stepping into a different universe. For all of Cat's life, the table and chairs had been covered with dusty bed sheets. When she was small, the room was the perfect place to play, but she hadn't been in it for years. The walls were a duller white than she remembered. Like many of the unused rooms in Casa Medianoche, it had stored boxes, trunks, and books.

 Now the sheets had been put away, the boxes moved, the curtains opened, the windows washed, the black walnut table polished, the chairs dusted, and the tile floor cleaned so it shone. Olujimi was setting out a pitcher of water and a thermos of coffee next to a jumble of mugs that made Cat wonder if no one could find the good dinnerware or if it had been sold to pay a bill.

 Olujimi grinned. "Hey, Tiger." Then he squinted at Tarika. Auntie Fong said, "Val's idea." Professor M said, "Tarika's idea." Cat said, "We just backed it up."

 "O-kay," Olujimi said slowly, clearly thinking it wasn't wise. "Life's never dull around Val."

 Cat almost said life had been dull for fourteen years, but watching her father roll across the room, she realized it hadn't. It had been quiet and dependable, which, for him, must have been the greatest gift he could give.

 At the far end of the room, with the goateed stranger, were Ilya and Ms. Arkan. She wore a gray suit with a white shirt. He wore a brown jacket, tan trousers, and a green T-shirt. He looks good in those colors, Cat thought. Not gorgeous like Baldomero, but good.

 Their eyes met, and she caught him looking away as quickly as she did.

 Everyone was dressed nicely. Had her father meant "dress up" when he said, "wash up"? It didn't matter. Everyone was going to stare at her no matter what she wore.

 Her father wheeled toward her with the young Middle Eastern man. His Ouroboros ring held a blue sapphire. "Cat, meet Saeed al-Rahman. Saeed, my daughter, Cat."

 "Nice to meet you," she said. Was she supposed to offer her hand, or was he? By the time she had asked herself the question, it felt too late to offer hers. She added, "Uh, I hope."

 "As do I," said Mr. Rahman with a polite nod. Cat thought, Do all the clan leaders learn to hide their emotions? I guess they have to.

 Ms. Arkan jerked her hand toward Tarika. "What's she doing here?" The ruby on her finger flashed in the light, and Cat thought, If they're supposed to learn it, they don't all succeed.

 Professor M said, "The First of the Medianoches wants her here."

 Ms. Arkan's nostrils flared. "The problem with you, Valentin, is you don't respect tradition."

 "Then you should be happy. Doesn't the head of the hosting clan have the right to invite anyone?"

 "Which hasn't been done in four hundred years." "And the winner of the respecting tradition contest is--?" "Have your joke, Valentin. Involve a child in a war she's not prepared for. I only hope you find her drained body, not me." "How old was your son when you took him on his first hunt?" Ilya said quietly, "Twelve." Ms. Arkan said, "He began his training in the crib! He's never been a child, but if you have your way, that girl--" She pointed at Tarika. "-- will never be an adult!"

 Auntie Fong said, "Val's within his rights, Alexandra. For better or worse, it's what the girls want." She shook her head. "Tarika, why don't you sit across from Ilya?"

 Cat said, "We'll be the kiddie section," and started to follow. But Auntie Fong leaned close to her and whispered, "Head of the table by your father, dear. Return his ring as discreetly as possible."

 Cat looked at the Medianoche ring. Her father must've meant she could wear it for her birthday since it would be hers someday.

 Auntie Fong whispered, "Dear? One more thing. What we decide today has nothing to do with affection. My fondness for you could not be stronger."

 Cat blinked, but Auntie Fong had already turned away. Cat thought,

 She's going to vote against me! Auntie Fong is going to--

 She wanted to shout or cry, but if she couldn't control her feelings, how could she make anyone believe she could control her thirst? She thought, Okay. Not about emotions. Just have to convince Auntie Fong to vote for me. One more besides Dad and Uncle Olujimi, and I'm safe.

 She slid the turquoise ring off and went to the head of the table. A single chair waited there.

 She sat. On her left were Auntie Fong, Saeed al-Rahman, Ms. Arkan, and Ilya. On her right were her father, Olujimi, and Tarika. Three clan representatives on one side, two on the other. Does that mean anything? Did Auntie Fong mean she would vote against me, or she could vote against me?

 As Cat swallowed, Olujimi gave her a thumbs-up. She smiled weakly. Everyone looked like they were trying to keep from looking worried. Only her father didn't look worried at all.

 The meeting's just a formality. Get it over with. She put the Medianoche ring in her father's hand. He frowned. "You don't want it?"

 "Auntie Fong said--"

 "Ah." He raised the turquoise ring high for everyone to see. "This is the ring worn by the First of Clan Medianoche." He gave it to Cat. "So you should put it back on."

 She stared at him, then realized everyone else was staring at her. He added, "To please the traditionalists." Ms. Arkan said, "Valentin! We're here to decide what to do about that girl, and you--" "Ah, Xandra!" Professor M said. "Sorry about the misunderstanding.

 We aren't here to decide what to do about Cat. You're here to meet the new First of my clan."

 Auntie Fong said, "Val. I wish we'd discussed this." "Has any First discussed the choice of successor with anyone?" "No, but--" "I'm beginning to appreciate tradition more and more." Cat looked at her father. "Dad! No way I'm ready for this." He nodded. "Good. People who think they're ready never are."

 She set the ring on the table before him. "You should keep it."

 He shook his head. "For fourteen years, I've known I should step aside. Any of the Medianoches in Peru or Spain would've made a fine First. They've been too polite to suggest I step down. I exploited that for one reason. When Baldomero said you might turn, I made a vow. If you became a nighter, I would kill you so the next First could serve without bearing the weight of your death."

 Cat wanted to ask what he would've done after killing her, then decided she didn't want to know. "So give it to one of them now."

 He shook his head again. "The First does two things, conducts meetings and leads missions. Given your abilities--"

 "I don't want to kill anyone." "A good reason you should lead." Frowning, Olujimi said, "You'll stop killing nighters?" Professor M said, "That's one of the things we'll discuss." Ms. Arkan said, "It's not." Auntie Fong said, "I'm beginning to wonder if we'll discuss anything." Professor M looked at Cat. "Someone has to put on the ring and call the meeting to order." He folded his hands in his lap. Cat said, "Can I appoint someone else when I'm First?" He nodded. Cat said, "Good," and slipped the ring on her finger. Professor M said, "You accept the responsibility of leading the

 Medianoches?" "I do. And I appoint--" "Sorry. Can't appoint anyone until you're twenty-one or your adviser agrees you should appoint someone." "You didn't tell me that!" "I wasn't your adviser then." "Val," Ms. Arkan said. "You're making a mockery of clan business." Professor M nodded. "Yes, Xandra. Because this wasn't clan business until you demanded a meeting. This should only be a matter for the Medianoches."

 Auntie Fong said, "Val, your daughter is a nighter." "Half," Professor M said. Ms. Arkan said, "She drinks human blood." "She hasn't killed."

 "Would you spare a rabid dog until it killed someone?" "She's no dog!" Olujimi leaned toward Cat. "Call for silence." Ms. Arkan told Professor M, "True. She's ten thousand times more dangerous." "I know what my daughter is." "Like you knew what her mother was?" "Damn it, Xandra! Give her time--" "To spring the de la Sombras' trap?" "To convince you--" "With glamour? "With facts!" "Quiet!" Cat shouted. To her amazement, everyone sat back and looked at her. When her father nodded, she said, "Uh, thanks. Where do we start?"

 Ms. Arkan's hand shot high into the air. Olujimi and Saeed al- Rahman lifted their hands, and Auntie Fong raised her index finger from the table.

 Cat looked at the four clan heads. What was the best way to get them on her side? Nothing Ms. Arkan would say could be good. Start with Olujimi because he was friendliest? Or with Mr. Rahman because he seemed neutral? She was afraid to hear what Auntie Fong thought.

 The only way Cat could imagine getting Auntie Fong's vote was by showing her respect. Cat said, "Auntie Fong?"

 Auntie Fong nodded. "We must decide what you are." Professor M said, "We know--" Cat said, "Dad!" He inhaled deeply, then nodded.

 Auntie Fong said, "Thank you. Your father's playing a desperate game. By making you First of the Medianoches, our choice changes. If we treat you as a nighter, will the Five Clans become Four? That's not something I wish to see."

 Auntie Fong looked at the others. Olujimi shook his head. Mr. Rahman did the same. Alexandra Arkan shrugged.

 Auntie Fong said, "But the risk of having a nighter--" She glanced at Professor M. "--in nature, if not loyalty, among us is unimaginable. The idea that we could accept one in our council is unendurable, no matter--" She hesitated, then turned to Cat and said more softly. "No matter what we think of you. So, with your permission, I would first ask your father a question."

 Wondering why she hadn't started with Olujimi, Cat said, "Sure."

 Auntie Fong looked to Professor M. "Is your daughter a proper choice to lead your clan?"

 He said, "Auntie, you can't--" Auntie Fong said, "It's a fair question." He nodded. "True. She's not."

 As Cat tried to hide her hurt, Auntie Fong said, "Then we needn't--" Professor M said, "I haven't finished." "Oh?" "We don't get proper choices in life. We just get choices. I've watched the kid for fourteen years. She's made mistakes as foolish as anyone's, maybe even as foolish as mine. But every time, she's tried to fix what was wrong. If I'd paid less attention to what she is and more attention to who she is, I never would've worried about whether she would be a nighter or a human or anything else. I look at her now, and I think there's no way she's ready to be First of the Medianoches. But I also know she can learn what she needs to know. Maybe she's not a proper choice, but she's the best choice. Maybe I'll regret it because of something I'll do someday, but I'll never regret it for anything she'll do."

 Cat thought, Okay, best dad ever. Tarika's arm shot up high and waved from side to side. Auntie Fong said, "Yes?" Tarika said, "May I say something about Cat?" Auntie Fong smiled. "No need. Your presence speaks for you." Tarika said, "It better be yelling for me." Cat suspected that running to hug her father and best friend was not something Firsts do during meetings. She swallowed, then said, "Did you want to know something else, Auntie Fong?"

 "Yes. Why should we accept you as one of us?"

 Cat shrugged. "I don't know. I mean, okay, everyone's worried I'll get thirsty and kill somebody. But last night, I learned what the thirst is like. I'll do anything to keep it from taking over. If I have to drink soy milk twenty times a day, or if someone comes up with pills or a shot or an operation or anything that'll keep me from killing, I'll do it. The only way I might lose control is if I was on a desert island with someone. But the second I felt the thirst, I would help them tie me up or lock me up or --" Cat glanced at her father. "Or do anything they had to do to be safe."

 She looked back at Auntie Fong, then at Mr. Rahman, Ms. Arkan, and Uncle Olujimi. "I know that makes you worry. It makes me worry. For you, it's 'Cat could be a monster.' For me, it's 'I could be a monster.' That's megatomically worse. For the sake of everyone I love, I have to keep it under control. So I will." She nodded, thinking that must have been the lamest speech ever made by a First.

 No one spoke. She couldn't tell what they were thinking. She looked at her father, and he nodded. She knew what that meant: You did fine, whatever happens.

 She looked down the table. Tarika was smiling. Ilya was watching with an expression she couldn't read.

 Auntie Fong said, "That you can control your thirst, I accept. Your mother and uncle control theirs, when they choose. But the Five Clans have one purpose. We kill nighters. We've survived for centuries because our dedication never wavers. In an instant of doubt, a nighter can seize a person's will. Even if you were human, I would fear your loyalty would be divided, and that division would be our doom. Tell me you would kill your mother without hesitating, and I might accept your presence on our council. Tell me you would kill your father if a nighter took control of him, and you will have my vote."

 Cat said, "I can't tell you that! If there's a way to save someone--" Auntie Fong looked away. "I have no more questions." Cat glanced at her father. He shrugged, so Cat looked at the others.

 "Mr. Rahman?" Saeed al-Rahman smiled. "I like your honesty. I've always admired your father's boldness. I read his e-mail and Xandra's. Everything I've heard confirms my first opinion. I have no questions that might change it now."

 Cat thought, Meaning he's on my side? Ms. Arkan's side? He wants to look decisive but he hasn't decided? Leading missions might be easier than leading meetings.

 She glanced from Olujimi to Alexandra Arkan. If Olujimi can save me, he should speak last. "Ms. Arkan?"

 "Thank you." Ms. Arkan spoke more calmly than Cat expected. Then she realized Ms. Arkan did that from strategy, not kindness. "Valentin admits you're half-nighter. He suggests that because you can endure sunlight, we should think you're different. He's hiding the plain truth. You're very different. You can never be one of us. Yes, you saved people this morning. Why should we think that wasn't part of a plan to make us trust you?"

 Cat swallowed and looked around the room. Her father poured water into a glass and handed it to her. She sipped it, then shook her head. "Sorry. I got nothing. All I can say is it's not."

 Professor M lifted his hand. Cat said, "Dad?" He turned to Ms. Arkan. "If I were Baldomero and that was my plan,

 I would kill you, then have Cat save the kids. Creates just as much sympathy for her, and it weakens the clans. If he chose to let you live, he's a greater fool than I thought."

 Ms. Arkan smiled. "Why, Val. You do know how to flatter a woman." She looked back at Cat. "Baldomero's no fool. Saving me makes you look best to us. Giving up the chance to kill me then is easily worth the chance to kill us all soon."

 As frustration surged in her, Cat said coldly, "So I should go super- nighter on you now?"

 Ms. Arkan smiled. "I knew you had a temper tucked away."

 Cat inhaled, thought, If you want to see my temper-- She said, "If I'm so dangerous--"

 "Nighters are patient," Ms. Arkan said. "Your cousin might want you to stay with us for years to learn our secrets. Then his people could destroy every branch of the clans in a night. He knows that however deadly you are now, you'll be deadlier when you're grown. He has every reason to wait. Which is why we have none."

 Cat thought. That went well. Not. Uncle Olujimi, if you can save me, now's the time! She said, "Uncle Olujimi?"

 His eyes were kind and sad, reminding her of her father's. He said, "Cat, if what happened to you happened to one of my daughters, I pray she would handle it as well as you. I met you as a quiet baby almost fourteen years ago. I've seen you grow into a fine young woman. Everything I've seen and heard tells me your father and your young friend believe everything you've said. Just as I do."

 He glanced at Professor M, then told the room, "Even if I didn't think this because of my many years knowing Cat, I would hear Val's words, and I would believe them. I have six brothers and sisters. Five are named Udofia. One is named Medianoche. Like many in the clans, Val and I learned of the nighters before we were told. When we were fourteen--"

 He looked at Ilya, then Tarika, then Cat, then continued, "We decided to kill a nighter and impress our parents. It was the most foolish thing anyone in the clans has done, and our parents were not impressed. But Val and I learned that we can trust each other completely. From that day, whenever I made a decision as an Udofia, I asked myself first how it would affect the Medianoches."

 He turned back to Cat, "Everything in me says to support you. Let this be known to everyone here. And especially, to you, Catalina Medianoche. You honor your father and your family. There could be no finer First of the Medianoches, and no one I would rather serve with on the council of the Five Clans."

 Cat thought, Crying in gratitude, bad now. She said quietly, "Thank you."

 Olujimi shook his head. "Don't thank me. I must continue." He looked again at Professor M, then Cat. "There's no way that you would choose to betray us. I know this. If you used glamour to make me feel as

 I do, I would sense it. My heart and my mind both know that you're a good and honest girl. No, woman."

 He looked down at his Ouroboros ring, then held it up. "But I wear this ring. My duty is not to my heart or my mind." He looked at Val. "It's not to the brother I love." He looked at Cat. "It's not to the young woman I love as much as any of my daughters. My duty is to our cause."

 He looked at Auntie Fong, Mr. Rahman, and Ms. Arkan. "As is yours."

 Cat felt something heavy settle on her chest. She tried to breathe casually as Olujimi looked back at her. His eyes were like her father's at midnight, when he had fired the bolt at her heart. He said, "My duty says Baldomero de la Sombra could make you think you are free when you are not. What I see now is the young woman you are. But if that nighter has planted--"

 "No!" said Professor M, slamming the table. "Olujimi. Trust me! I would know--"

 Olujimi held up his ring again, looked from it to Professor M, then back to Cat. "If that nighter planted a command in your mind, Cat, when it's triggered, I will see his creature, someone with a nighter's strengths, but not its weaknesses. Someone who could destroy the Five Clans. Someone who could condemn humanity to slavery or worse."

 He closed his eyes, inhaled, opened them, exhaled, and said, "If you were my own daughter, I couldn't risk that. Your father was right last night, Cat. We must do what he could not."

 Professor M said, "Try to harm her, and one of us will have a dead brother."

 "Val, think!" Olujimi said. "It's war! To win, we do what we must. You know this."

 "She's my daughter!"

 "You think I have no heart? If I could give you my right arm instead, I would. If I could give you my life instead, I would. All I can do is promise the beasts of the night will pay for what they have forced upon us."

 "No, Olujimi. I tried to kill her once. That's enough." "No one expects you to do this. Nor to vote for it." "Only to accept it." "Because it's necessary."

 "No!" "Will you go against the Five Clans?" Professor M nodded. "Vote against her, and it's Four Clans." "Then the nighters win, no matter what we do."

 "Not if you accept Cat. Keep the clans together."

 Olujimi breathed slowly, then said, "It's better to have Four Clans and no doubt than Five and the constant fear of betrayal. You know--"

 "Stop telling me what I know, hermano."

 Professor M spoke the last word like the cruelest insult. Cat shouted, "Stop it! Just stop it!" She pointed at her finger. "Ring! Stop it, please!" She turned to Olujimi. "If the Medianoches leave the Five Clans, what happens?"

 "If? You don't make this easy, but then, you shouldn't. If this happens, I'll vote for the Four Clans to seek your death as quickly as possible." He looked at Professor M. "And anyone who comes between us must be treated as an ally of the nighters."

 Professor M said, "I'm up for--" Cat said, "Ring! Does it mean anything?" Professor M nodded. Cat asked Olujimi, "So it'd be a war between the families. The four clans against Tia Belen in Lima, Primo Rolando in Cordoba--" Olujimi nodded. "Against everyone who stayed loyal to you. I don't know how many would die. But I know the Medianoches don't have the resources to win." Cat looked down at the family ring. A piece of the turquoise was broken off. Someone had hit it against something, accidentally or intentionally. That was the result. Results stayed with you forever.

 Her father thought the ring would protect her, but it made her the leader. Who should leaders protect? She said, "We'll respect the council's decision."

 Professor M said, "Cat!" She held up the ring. "First of the Medianoches." He said, "No. No way, Cat. No--" She took his hand and squeezed it. Then she said, "What kind of adviser are you?" "I'm your fa--" "You're the Medianoches' adviser, right?" "Don't do this. Cat. Don't." She looked at Olujimi, Auntie Fong, Mr. Rahman, and Ms. Arkan, then nodded. "Let's vote." 

 Chapter Fourteen

 : Death in the Afternoon

 Ilya leaped to his feet, pointed at Cat, and shouted at Ms. Arkan, "She saved us! She saved me, and you, and Tarika! That's all you need to know! She saved us." He looked at the others. "That's it. The whole stupid trial. All this talking. All the what ifs and maybes and who knows, while the important thing is right there! She saved us."

 "Ilya," Ms. Arkan said. "Sit down."

 "No! You're going to vote to kill her like that makes it okay, like the difference between us and the nighters is we have a nice vote, but it's not true. Vote to kill her, and you're as bad as them."

 Ms. Arkan said, "Son. We're not as bad as they are. We are worse. We must be, to win."

 Ilya looked at Cat. His eyes were wet and his nose was running as he said, "Don't. Not everyone in the clans will go along with this. Not if we tell them--"

 "Ilya!" Ms. Arkan said. "You can't change the vote, so sit down and be quiet."

 "Mother, you said when you know what's right, you must do everything, no matter what."

 "To defeat nighters, my son. Not to save a poor girl--" She stopped, then nodded. "Yes. We can't know the truth about her, but whether we'll be voting to kill an innocent child or a fiend--" She shook her head. "It doesn't matter. Sit."

 "No." "We'll vote whether you sit or not." "If I sit, I'm agreeing to your vote. I don't." "Ilya--" Ms. Arkan looked at the end of the table. Tarika was standing. She said, "Ditto." Ms. Arkan said, "No one cares what children--" Professor M grunted as he pushed against the arms of his wheelchair to stand unsteadily before them. Cat squeezed her eyes together, then wiped them with her fingertips and opened them. She held her hands in front of her face, staring at the turquoise ring, then put her hands on the table. "Everybody. Thank you. Now sit, and we'll vote."

 Ilya said, "Don't, Cat. It's stupid." "Thanks a lot." "You're trying to do what's right, but this is wrong!" Cat pointed at the ring. Ilya said, "It's just an old ring! There are all these stupid traditions

 --" "Ilya. I don't want anyone to die for me. That's what's stupid." "And then what? The war goes on like it always has!" "I can't change that." "I thought you wanted to. I thought that's why Mother doesn't trust you." "I want it over! But what's the choice? Accept what the council decides or start a war between the clans, and then what happens? Nothing changes, or the nighters win. Nothing changing isn't much, but it's better than that, isn't it?"

 Ilya shook his head. Cat said, "Sit. Ilya. Please." He said, "I'll only recognize one decision by the council," and sat. "What he said," Tarika said as she sat. Cat looked at her father. "Dad?" "Likewise," said Professor M, lowering himself into his chair. Cat studied him. "If you're tempted to go against the council--" "'Tempted' doesn't begin to describe it." "Think about who would join you, Dad. Then say who you want dead." "You don't play fair." "Where did I learn that?" She looked at the clan representatives.

 "Okay. Uh, I'm not sure how to phrase the question." Olujimi lifted his hand. Cat said, "Yes?" He winced, then said, "Yes or no. For the good of the Five Clans, must Cat Medianoche be killed?" She nodded. "Should that include how?" "How depends on--" He looked down, then back at her. "How depends on whether you accept the vote or flee. If you accept it, you can choose what you-- Ah, what you choose. If you flee, it's the duty of everyone here to try to kill you in any way possible. If you escape, that'll apply to every member and ally of the Five Clans."

 She nodded again. "Got it. Yes or no--" Professor M said, "Cat, for the love of God--" "Love of everybody, Dad. Yes or no. Should--" She swallowed.

 "Should I, uh, Catalina Milagros Medianoche, be killed?" Ms. Arkan added, "For the good of the Five Clans."

 Cat repeated, "For--" Olujimi said, "That's not necessary." "Now I ask each of you?" "Yes." "Uncle Olujimi?" "Yes." "'Yes' meaning--?" "Meaning yes. I'm sorry. But yes." Cat thought, Okay, get the easy one over with. "Ms. Arkan?" Ms. Arkan looked down at the table, then at Ilya. He said, "No!

 Mother, no!" She looked out the window, then at Cat, and nodded. "Yes." Ilya hit the table with his fist. Cat shook her head, and he looked away. She turned to Auntie Fong and Mr. Rahman. "Mr. Rahman?" "No." "No?" she repeated, blinking at him. "No. Wars are not won by those who only do the safe thing. There's a time for boldness. No, I say." He looked at Auntie Fong. "Let Cat Medianoche live."

 Cat thought, Two to two. Two to two! I might-- She said, "Auntie Fong?"

 Auntie Fong looked at Mr. Rahman. "Wars are not won by those who never do the safe thing." She turned to Cat. "I am very sorry, Catalina. Yes. You must die."

 Cat sat in silence, hearing only her thoughts. I must die. I just turned fourteen. I must die. It'll save a lot of lives. Why can't something save mine? Ilya's right. It's stupid. It's stupid to kill anyone because everyone will die sometime anyway. Why hurry death for anyone?

 Because I can't save my life, but I can save others.

 She realized the silence was only in her mind. In the dining room, everyone was shouting and nearly everyone was standing and she couldn't make out any of the words. She stood, raised her hand high, and yelled, "Ring!"

 Everyone fell quiet. Cat said, "I've got an hour?" Olujimi nodded. "Is the meeting over?" He shook his head.

 "What's left?" "You accept the decision?" She looked at Ilya and Tarika, then her father. "Yes. First of the Medianoches. Yes."

 Olujimi said, "Then you can end the meeting and--" He looked at Professor M as he looked away. Olujimi turned back at Cat. "And have the hour to do as you wish. But after that time--"

 "Any loyal member of the Five Clans is supposed to kill me." He nodded. Ms. Arkan said, "Cat. Several of my people are watching this house." "So I shouldn't try to escape?" "Or if you want to go outside in the next hour, someone must go with you." Cat looked at Tarika and her father. "I don't want to go anywhere else." It was strange to see the people she loved being so sad and so angry at the same time. She was grateful for an excuse to look away when Olujimi said, "Someone has to stay near you. Until."

 "Who?" "Whoever is chosen. Or you choose. To ensure--" "I die. In an hour." He nodded. "How do you--" Professor M said, "Give her some time, at least!" Olujimi said, "The hour's begun. The sooner the details are arranged

 --" Less than an hour. She glanced out the window. The sky was the deepest Arizona blue. Were clouds whiter in Arizona because of the clear sky? Last night, she had thought she would never see the day again. Now she would never see the night.

 She looked at the four representatives. "I can't kill myself. I would just keep waiting for a miracle. One of you has to. I get to choose?"

 Olujimi nodded, and then the others did.

 "I don't care how. Whatever's fastest and most painless, because, ouch, bad. As for who--" She pointed at Saeed al-Rahman.

 He touched his chest. "Me?" She nodded. "But I never wanted this!" "You'll go along with the decision, right?" She saw his lips tighten. Then he said, "Yes." "And if I choose you, you'll do it."

 His nostrils flared with an inhalation. Then he repeated, "Yes." Professor M raised his hand. Cat said, "Yes?" "That's not fair. Xandra started this. Olujimi finished it. Let one of them--" Auntie Fong said, "I should do it. My vote--"

 Cat pointed at her ring and told her father, "The only one you might be able to forgive someday is Mr. Rahman."

 As Professor M looked down, Ilya stood and shouted at Cat, "Don't you care? You can't just do this like--"

 Ms. Arkan tugged on his arm. "Respect her choice." Cat met Ilya's eyes and nodded. He groaned in despair, and sat. Cat said, "Anything else?" Olujimi said, "When you adjourn the meeting, Auntie Fong, Xandra,

 Ilya, and I will join the ones outside. We'll return at--" He glanced at his watch. "Four twenty-five. Saeed must stay near you, but if you give your word you won't escape, he can give you some privacy."

 Cat nodded. "I promise. That's it?" She studied each face. Ilya and Olujimi were staring at the table. Her father had his eyes closed. She looked at Tarika last and thought, I wish Dad hadn't let her come, but I'm glad he did.

 She said, "Adjourned."

 Professor M grabbed her hand, gasped once, then released it. Everyone else stood. Olujimi, Mr. Rahman, Auntie Fong, and the Arkans went toward the door as Tarika ran to hug Cat, who thought, Best friends forever, as they embraced, though she couldn't say it.

 Then she pushed Tarika back and called, "Ilya? Can you stay? If you want? I mean, you can stay. If you want."

 He said, "If you want." Ms. Arkan said, "Ilya--" He glared at her. She nodded and left. Professor M said, "Cat? We'll do this any way you want. Don't worry about hurting anyone's feelings. We can all go, or we can all stay, or you can say who you want to see when, or whatever you like."

 Cat said, "I wish I could eat ice cream now."

 He nodded. "We got coconut sorbet while you were napping. I could go get some. I'll go get some. I'll fix it in the kitchen. Come when-- Whenever." He spun his chair and rolled out. In the hallway, Mr. Rahman closed the door, leaving Cat alone with Ilya and Tarika.

 Ilya said, "Throw me across the room so no one can say I helped, then go."

 Tarika looked out the window. "There's a big guy at the corner of the house. You can outrun him. The sooner you do it, the better. They'll expect you to wait a while before trying anything, I bet."

 Cat said, "I gave my word."

 Tarika said, "You heard them! It doesn't matter what you say in a war! This is our war right now."

 Ilya said, "It's true. Any of them would lie to the enemy. Right now, they're--" Cat said, "Doing what they think is best." Ilya nodded. "Which is stupid." Cat said, "I wanted to thank you. For--" "So escape! That's thanking me." "The big guy outside the window?" "Uncle Istvan. He's not slow, but you could, uh--" "He's armed, and he's fought nighters." Ilya nodded. Cat said, "And if he yells, Mr. Rahman comes in." Ilya nodded again. "And they know I'm in this room, so your Uncle Istvan isn't the only one watching this side of the house." "Why do you say this?" "Do you want me to kill your uncle?" "No!"

 "Then how--" "I'll jump him. That'll distract him." "And you'll be helping me, and they'll have to kill you." Tarika said, "I'll be your hostage. They can't blame anyone if--" Ilya shook his head. "If a nighter has a hostage-- You blame the nighter and shoot through the hostage." Tarika said, "Okay. What's that leave?" Cat said, "Having coconut sorbet." "But--"

 "Having coconut sorbet with you guys would be really good." Tarika frowned. "You don't even know if you like coconut sorbet." "It'll still be good." "That's stupid, Cat." Ilya coughed slightly, as if clearing his throat, then shook his head.

 "No. I had lemon sorbet in Venice. It was good. Coconut sorbet. That is probably good, too."

 Tarika said, "We can't just--" Cat nodded. "Can. Please, Tee." "It's--" "I know."

 Tarika nodded. "Okay. Sorbet." Cat smiled. "Rhymes." Tarika gave a small smile in return. "I'm a don't-know-it-poet." Cat said, "The best. Hug?" Tarika nodded and stepped close. Cat said, "Ilya? If you'd like--"

 He nodded and stepped in to join them. Cat thought, Okay. This is good. Lots of people don't get this much. I'm going to cry really hard now if-- She said, "Sorbet?"

 "Okay," Tarika agreed, and Ilya nodded.

 Cat went to the door and tapped. Mr. Rahman opened it. Cat said, "We're ready for sorbet. You can join us."

 He shook his head. "If you change your mind--" "I won't." "But if you do--" "I wish you hadn't chosen me." "If, you know, it's got to be, I think you're the best choice." He closed his eyes. Cat thought, I could hit him and run down the hall and charge through the yard and maybe every shot would miss-- But they wouldn't miss. This way is better for everyone else, and it's just the same for me.

 Mr. Rahman opened his eyes. "My opinion of you has only grown since I came here."

 "Thank you."

 In the kitchen, her father was sitting at the table. He turned toward Cat, but before he could speak, Cat said, "Sorbet?"

 He pointed at the bowls, each holding a single white mound. "I found mango chunks, then thought of almonds--"

 "It looks great." "Want two scoops? You could have--" She shook her head. "One's perfect." She sprinkled almonds and mango into her bowl, then went to the table and set a chair in the sun. She thought, Sunlight is nice. Hot, but nice. Okay, skin cancer sucks, but sunlight is nice.

 She looked at the coconut sorbet. What if she didn't like it? It was a bad time to hurt anyone's feelings.

 She looked at the others. They were waiting for her to take the first bite. She thought, This is easier for me. I've only got to be strong for a few minutes, but they have to live with this for the rest of their lives.

 She picked up the bowl. The sorbet didn't quite look like ice cream. It looked more ice, less cream. It smelled like coconut. She imagined a coconut, brown and furry, split in half, its milk and flesh bare. She should've shared one recently with Dad or Tarika.

 She scooped half a spoonful of sorbet and put it in her mouth. Cold was good when it wasn't too cold. Sweet was good when it wasn't too sweet. She swallowed. It wasn't wonderful, but it was really, really good. And really, really good, she realized, was wonderful enough. She nodded. "Good choice." Professor M looked away. "Glad to hear it, kid." Ilya said, "Coconut is even better than lemon." Cat thought, He and I could've gotten a pint of each and compared.

 Like, at a picnic, or something. That would've been nice. I never had a date, and he would be the best date ever. Maybe he and Tee will go on a date. I could say they should, but that might jinx them.

 She took a bite with mango, then smiled. "Mango's great with this."

 Tarika said, "Fruit sugars must not bother, uh, I mean, I'm glad. Mango is great."

 Cat took a bite with almonds. She liked the crunch between her teeth. She thought, I should've eaten more almonds. Would cashews be even better? I should suggest that. No. They'll think they should've bought cashews, and the dessert isn't what matters. But it's nice.

 Each bite tasted better than the one before. When she got to the last, she thought, I could save that for a minute. Then she thought, That would be really melodramatic. I just want to finish this treat now as if I'm just finishing a treat.

 The last bite was best. She said, "That was totally ex," and looked at the clock. 4:20. She thought, The end is near.

 That was funny. But if she laughed, she would have to explain, and no one else would agree.

 She carried her bowl to the sink. Her father said, "I'll get that."

 Cat said, "It's okay." She turned on the water and set the bowl and spoon under it. The water was cool, and then it was warmer. She should've paid more attention to water. She squirted soap into the wash pad. Peppermint was a great scent for soap. She washed the bowl. It had a chip in the side, and she had meant to throw it out, but Dad had said it was still useful, and she was glad he did, because he was right. She touched her finger to the chip, then set the bowl in the dish drainer.

 Tarika was watching her. Ilya was looking at the pepper shaker that looked like a black Scottish Terrier which had a white mate for salt that was broken or lost a long time ago, but Cat couldn't remember which. Her father was staring at the crayon drawing on the refrigerator that she had made in first grade. A green man in a wheelchair sat beside a purple girl, and they both had huge grins. Under the man was written "DADDy" and under the girl "CAt."

 She stepped beside her father. He put his arm around her waist, and she rested her hand on his head. After a minute or two, he said, "I love you, Cat."

 "I know, Dad." She bent over and kissed his forehead. "I love you, too."

 Someone was by the door. She looked up. Saeed al-Rahman said, "It's time."

 She took the Medianoche ring off her finger and held it out to her father.

 He said, "I don't--" Then he nodded and took it.

 More people came to the door. She glanced up: Ms. Arkan, Auntie Fong, and Uncle Olujimi. She had never seen Olujimi look sadder. Auntie Fong's expression made Cat embarrassed: it was respect. But Ms. Arkan's face seemed the most troubled. Then Cat understood why: Ms. Arkan would be happier if Cat tried to fight or escape. That would prove the vote had gone correctly.

 She didn't want to think about people who thought she should die. She said, "Dad? Would it be okay to give Tarika the big mirror? I mean, if--"

 "Sure," he said.

 She looked at Ilya. "I would give you something, but I don't know what you like."

 Ilya said, "I like you."

 She said, "Okay. I mean, I like you. You can have my purple blanket, or--" She looked at Tarika. "You two divide the stuff in my room. Give what you don't want to someone who can use it, okay?"

 Tarika nodded. "Don't worry."

 "Thanks, Tee." Cat looked at the people she loved. "No one has to stay. Really."

 Professor M said, "You can't order me away, kid. Anything else--" "It's not an order. It's just okay." "Good." Cat looked at Tarika and Ilya. "Really."

 Tarika whispered, "Staying." Ilya nodded. Cat looked at Mr. Rahman. "Okay." He said, "Where do you want to, ah, go?" "Outside?" "Sorry. The neighbors." "Oh. Right." "The garage?" Cat shook her head. The garage was dark and dusty and full of cobwebs, a great place to play when she was a girl, but not the last place she wanted to see. She wanted to stand at her bedroom window and look at the mountains. But it was a great room. She didn't want anyone to go there and think about her death instead of her life.

 Maybe the basement? But it was as dark as the garage, and that was where Granny Lupe--where Mama--had lived. Or the parlor? Aunt Ysabel had died there. Maybe Cat should, too.

 But she wanted a place of her own, where she could look at the mountains and try not to think about anything at all.

 No one ever used the dining room. You could see mountains in almost any direction in Tucson. She said, "The dining room?"

 Mr. Rahman nodded.

 Cat said, "Can I be looking out the window and not see what happens?"

 He nodded again. "It'll be fast?" "Very." "Okay." She stepped toward the door, thinking, Goodbye, kitchen.

 Breakfast was best, but it was always good eating here with Dad and Granny Lupe.

 In the hall, she thought, Goodbye, hallway. You were a great place to skate, even if Dad and Granny Lupe didn't agree.

 In the dining room, she thought, Hello, dining room. It's too bad Dad isn't rich so you can be beautiful again. But you're pretty. You're a good place to be.

 She went to the nearest window. Hello, window. This is a good view. If I was a window, I would be proud of a view like this. It's not as dramatic as an upstairs view, but who needs drama all the time?

 She turned to face everyone. Why didn't I think of some last words? I should've been ready. She said, "Make things better, okay? And don't worry about me because, you know, it's been totally the best. Really." She looked at her father and Tarika. "I love you."

 The professor nodded. Tears were rolling down his cheeks, and Cat wondered why she had ever thought his face was a mask.

 Tarika put both hands in front of her, cupping them together in the shape of a heart.

 Cat smiled. Tarika gasped and began crying loudly. Cat's father squeezed Tarika's arm, and the crying continued.

 Ilya was staring at the floor. He looked up. Cat realized Tarika's sobs weren't the only ones in the room. Ilya shook his head fiercely. His eyes were wide and pleading. Cat bit her lip, then nodded. He stopped shaking his head, but his tears continued.

 She looked at Uncle Olujimi and Auntie Fong, then at Ms. Arkan. She thought, Do I forgive them? How can I forgive them? This is what they wanted. They should live with it. They should live with it forever.

 Then she looked closer at their faces and said, "I know you didn't want this."

 She glanced back at her dad and Tarika. Tee still held her hands together like a heart. Dad still held Tarika's arm. Cat knew she would break into tears in another second, so she told Mr. Rahman. "I'll look out the window now."

 He nodded, and she turned away. She had thought she would stare at the mountains, but she was watching the sky. Her last words had been, "I'll look out the window now." She smiled. She should tell Dad to put that on her tombstone. People would see it and go, "What's that mean?"

 But she didn't want a tombstone. She wanted her ashes scattered in the desert. She had told him that years ago. Did he remember?

 He was her dad. Of course he remembered. She thought, Blue is prettier than I knew. She should have asked for music. Why didn't she ask Tee to sing something? Not now, but earlier. Eating coconut sorbet and listening to Tee sing would've been perfect.

 Someone was crying softly near the hallway. Mr. Rahman stepped behind her. She heard cloth rustling. His suit. He was reaching inside his jacket. He was taking something out. Would it hurt much?

 It would hurt as much as it hurt. Then it wouldn't.

 Blue is nice, she thought. How far do you see when you see blue in the sky?

 She smelled metal. If it was a gun, would she hear him cock it? Do you only cock old-fashioned guns?

 In the blue, two dark shapes appeared, growing quickly. The silhouettes of birds flying free. As fine a last sight as anyone could want.

 She heard Mr. Rahman inhale softly.

 Two birds. Large and black and beautiful. Flying toward Casa Medianoche.

 She heard cloth sliding between Mr. Rahman's arm and ribs as he thrust something toward her heart.

 She thought, A fine last sight. Two ravens. 

 Chapter Fifteen

 : A Proposal

 Cat spun, catching Mr. Rahman's wrist, and saw his knife and his amazement. "Sorry." She pointed with her free hand at the ravens. "Nighters coming."

 Ms. Arkan reached into her jacket, shouting, "It's a trick!" Then she, Olujimi, Auntie Fong, Mr. Rahman, and Ilya were all drawing pistols and knives from shoulder holsters, sleeve holsters, and ankle holsters. The guns were smaller than bolt pistols, but they didn't look like any weapons Cat knew.

 She thought, As if I know what normal pistols look like.

 The knives were all different and all similar: dark metal with grooves on their sides.

 She thought, For letting blood flow.

 Professor M flicked a sword from the back of his chair to touch Alexandra Arkan's chin. She froze, her pistol half-extended toward Cat, who still held Mr. Rahman's wrist. Professor M said, "Cat doesn't lie."

 Ms. Arkan said, "Valentin. You would make this even worse?" Professor M nodded. "I have a reputation to maintain." Only Tarika was unarmed. She had moved back to the wall. Ilya handed her his knife, then gripped his pistol in both hands and looked around the room.

 Auntie Fong said, "Val?" She and Olujimi kept their guns pointing upward, but they would only need an instant to aim at Cat or her father.

 Cat released Mr. Rahman's wrist. "Keep your knife. You may need --"

 Olujimi pointed outside. "It's true!"

 Two ravens flew at the windows, but two nighters burst through the glass: Zoraida de la Sombra, her black hair tied back in a tail, clad in blood-red boots and trousers and sweater, and Baldomero, his black hair swept back like wings, wearing a black motorcycle jacket, gray cargo pants, and black commando boots.

 The humans scrambled back and fired, their pistols sounding like toy air guns. Sharp wooden bolts as long as fingers flew through the air, but the nighters turned as if dancing, dodging every shot.

 Cat screamed, "Stop it! Everyone! Don't fight!"

 The shooting stopped. For an instant, she thought everyone was obeying her. Then the weight of the world pulled on her arms and legs, making them too heavy to lift. All around her, pistols and knives clattered to the floor, followed by the clang of her father's sword. It was easier to turn her eyes than her head as she looked to see what was happening.

 Every human stood perfectly still, with calm faces and desperate eyes. Zoraida kept her gaze fixed on them as Baldomero ran to Cat, calling, "My princess! Thank God we're in time!" He reached out as if to hug her.

 She flinched, glancing at her mother for help or advice. Zoraida's face never turned away from the humans.

 Glamour. Controlling people trained to resist it would take all of a nighter's concentration. But surely her mother could give her a nod, a smile, a word--

 Baldomero let his arms fall to his side. "You haven't forgiven me. I understand, Catalina. I haven't forgiven myself. I thought the easiest way to help you was to force you to feed. I was wrong. Very wrong. I'm sorry."

 Cat looked from the immobile humans to the shattered windows.

 Baldomero said, "The humans who watched outside? They've been sent home to sleep until morning. No one will bother us. Now--" He seized Mr. Rahman by the throat. "You dared threaten my beloved--"

 Cat said, "Let him go! A guy with a knife couldn't hurt me."

 "Unless he was fast. Or you trusted him." Baldomero released Mr. Rahman, then narrowed his eyes at Cat. "Or you let him."

 Professor M made a sound like a groan.

 Baldomero glanced at him. "Ah, father of all our hope. Were you wise, you wouldn't reveal that you can do anything at all."

 Zoraida's gaze flicked at last toward Cat and Baldomero. She said with great effort, "Nephew--"

 "No!" Baldomero commanded. "Catalina and I will speak. No one else."

 Zoraida's eyes narrowed, her nostrils flared, her lips tightened. Then she exhaled and nodded.

 Cat thought, He glammed Mama!

 "Catalina, I beg you, hear me out," Baldomero said. "We can rule this world, you as queen of the day, I as king of the night. Who could stand against us? Palaces would be yours. Your friends would be the people you see on magazine covers, not these no-ones."

 Cat glanced at Tarika and Ilya. "They're someones to me." Baldomero shrugged. "Then make them rich and famous so they're worthy of you. Let your whims become reality. No one will deny you." "Except you." "Why would I? Do you feel any glamour?" "Just a minute ago--"

 "We had to stop the humans so they wouldn't hurt themselves. But I freed you immediately, didn't I? Do you feel any glamour now? Even a hint?"

 She thought, I must, because he seems just like my handsome, mysterious cousin. But the only glamour I feel is from his smile. He's telling the truth.

 His smile grew wider, baring bright, perfect teeth. "I'm speaking to you as an equal, Cat. I hate saying no to those I love. Please me, and you'll be free of all compulsion."

 She glanced at her mother. A bruise on Zoraida's throat was marked with two dark dots.

 Baldomero nodded. "Yes. I had to bind her with a bite. That hurt me, but what could I do? She says we must try a new way, but new ways are weakness, and weakness is death. Could I let her hurt herself? Hurt us all? You've seen the Five Clans. Do they consider new ways?"

 Cat glanced at Olujimi, then shook her head.

 Baldomero looked at Professor M. "Let me guess. For the good of the family, the professor told you to sacrifice yourself--"

 "He wanted to fight them." "But you didn't?" "More people would die. And I'd still be dead." "Ah, Catalina. I like the professor more. He's right. Here's what you must know to rule. Love yourself more than anything." "I don't want to rule." "Be patient. You'll learn to want more than you can imagine. The point of power is to want more every day, then take what you want, then want even more."

 "But I've got all I want."

 He snorted. "A crumbling house and a father fighting a war he can't win?"

 She nodded. "A home and someone who loves me." He stared at her. "I've made you hate me." Should she lie to buy time? What would that gain? She nodded. "Then give me a way to make amends, Catalina. Surely there's something you want." "If nighters stopped killing humans--" "Why? Humans feast on lesser creatures." He smiled. "You want me to change the way of the world?"

 "But killing's not necessary!" "Power doesn't care what's necessary." "Love does." He smiled fondly. "Oh, my innocent! Master the glamour. Musicians and movie stars will adore you." She shook her head. His voice softened. "You don't want that?" "If they can't choose, it's not love." "I didn't choose to love you." Was there a special kind of glamour that no one could detect? She thought, He loves me. He's gorgeous. He wants me to be happy. Why not join him and be the best ruler the world has ever known?

 Because he doesn't even know he's a monster. She said, "You only love yourself."

 Baldomero put his hand over his heart. "There was a time when that was true. But I love my family. I would've gladly died in my mother's place. Nothing will harm you or Zoraida while I live. You must know that's true."

 Cat looked at her mother, a dark statue commanding human statues, and said, "Binding Mama isn't harming her?"

 "It's necessary. When we go, I'll free her and never restrain her again. I swear it."

 "You just use people."

 "We all use the people we love. Who can you love more than those who give you what you need?"

 "You want to give me what I need?" "With all my heart." "End the war between nighters and humans." He laughed. "Done!" She blinked. "Without killing?" "Without killing, because that pleases you." She squinted at him, trying to feel glamour, trying to hear a trick.

 "How?" "We'll bind their leaders, the most important priests, princes, and presidents. Through them--" "But I want everyone free!" He shook his head sadly. "You want a world that never existed." "That's kind of the point of making a better world." He smiled. "You misunderstand. You want a better world, so we'll make it, a healthy world of healthy humans. We'll build schools and hospitals and parks instead of armies and prisons and palaces. We'll feed them things that grow, and the land that was used for cattle will be forests and wetlands again. They'll live longer, healthier lives, and we'll have better stock to feed on. Isn't that best for everyone?"

 "And you won't kill?"

 "Some of us prefer to feed without killing. Some of us think death is a sweet dessert, but none of us kill every night. So I promise, after we save this world, only a thousand humans will be killed each year. In exchange, millions will be saved from their own madness. Isn't paradise worth a thousand deaths?"

 "Nobody kills in paradise."

 "Think, Catalina. Every year, a million humans die in cars. Millions more die from war, hunger, and disease. Their greed is destroying the earth. Their scientists say their civilization will fail in thirty years if they don't change their ways, but their leaders don't care. They happily destroy everything so they can die rich. What are a thousand, when millions will be saved?"

 "But we don't need to kill! Maybe we don't even need their blood! If you don't have to do something bad, and you do it anyway, it's the worst bad!"

 "You watch too much television." "Wrong is wro--" "No." His command seized her like being instantly shrink-wrapped.

 She thought, Be free! I must be free! But she could only move her eyes. She looked at her mother. Zoraida was as much a prisoner as she. When their gaze met, she heard a whisper in her head: I can't free you again, my fierce one. He's forbidden it.

 The whisper died as Baldomero said, "I can make you believe what I wish, but I gave you a choice. What more could anyone ask? Now you give me a choice. Free you, and the Ouroboros War continues? Or bind you and build Paradise? There's no real choice, is there? If I free you, you'll fight me. You may answer."

 Cat nodded. Baldomero clenched his fist. "You could have the good sense to lie!" "Would you believe me?" He smiled like the Baldomero she could love. "No. But if you pretended and worked with me, you would learn how sweet power is. The lie would become truth."

 "Then I can't."

 "No. And that's part of the reason I love you." He held his hand out. "Come here."

 Something tugged at her feet. She fought it, saying, "No." "Don't fear a kiss. I love you too much to hurt you."

 "I'm free!" she insisted, thinking, Aren't I? I must be. He said I'm strong. Be strong!

 His eyes widened, then narrowed. As her feet failed her, she stepped toward him.

 He nodded. "Accept it. Afterward, I'll make you think you're free. You won't suffer. You'll believe everything you do is for love. And it will be."

 "No!" She trembled as she strained to run for the door. Trying to disobey was like fighting a whirlwind. Her legs weakened, and she took another step closer to him.

 "You're all I need to be happy, Catalina. Surrender to me." "Still wrong! Baldomero, please. Don't." "One kiss, sweet Catalina. Then we'll be happy forever. I promise you that." She gasped as she took the last step to him. He caressed her cheek. "Yes. You'll be all I've hoped for." She couldn't step away. She felt the glamour grow with the touch of his cool fingers. Part of her hated him more than she ever had. Part of her wanted his kiss. She managed to glance away, knowing it was her last free act. She saw Tarika's eyes, wide with horror, and her father's, narrow with fury. She saw her mother's lips tremble as if she was trying to say something, despite the command that prevented her from helping.

 Baldomero said, "I love you, Catalina, as much as you shall love me. Now, come closer."

 His mouth opened. His fangs extended, long, ivory-white, and needle-sharp. His hand rested on the side of her face, drawing her into his embrace. His wrist was an inch from her lips.

 She thought, Obeying now, Baldomero. Coming closer. Then she turned her head. And bit. 

 Chapter Sixteen

 : The Queen of Shadows

 As she drank deeply of sweet, tart blood, the will of its vessel crumbled beneath hers. She would drain it, then drink from the other vessels around her to learn if one was best. Knowledge is good. She would learn the limit of how much she could drink, and then she would learn how to pass that limit. She held many vessels in a web of command, humans controlled by a nighter, that nighter controlled by another nighter, who gave his blood and his life to her, proving she ruled them all. Who could resist her?

 Something grabbed her arm and shouted, "Kid! Stop!" She swatted it. It skidded across the room, hit the wall, and fell. Something tried to pull her sustenance from her jaws and said, "My fury, don't kill him!" She kicked it. It landed on the dining table. Something shoved her shoulder, trying to separate her from the thrill of the blood, and screamed in her mind, Cat, don't be him! She grabbed its throat. The scream grew louder: Cat! Control! You got to get control-- She thought, Control is easy. She tore her lips from the first vessel and stared at the beast interrupting her meal. She thought, I can make you do any-- She heard, Cat? You're talking in my head? Yes. I can do anything I-- Prove it! By stopping!

 Why? Because it's wrong! And I care why? Because you're Cat! And Cat cares because she's Cat, no matter-- She gasped and thought, Tee? Cat spat blood and jerked her hand from Tarika's throat. Baldomero had slumped to his knees, and Zoraida was rolling off the dining room table, and Professor M was pulling himself up from the floor into his wheelchair, and Ilya and the heads of the Five Clans were lunging for weapons, and Tarika had her hand to her bruised throat as she stared at Cat.

 "Everyone, stop!" Cat screamed.

 They froze like a wax museum tableau. All eyes were on her. Her skull burned as she felt them fighting her will, and felt herself losing. When she failed, who would die in the fight?

 Olujimi managed a step toward Zoraida. Ms. Arkan's arm twitched. Her fingertips touched a pistol at her feet. Professor M drew himself further into his chair. And Cat's control crumbled. Ms. Arkan raised her pistol and shot twice, once at Cat, once at Zoraida. Cat twisted her head. The dart tore through her hair. She screamed, "Mama! Stop them!"

 Zoraida leaped forward. The second dart missed her as she threw Olujimi into Auntie Fong and Mr. Rahman. Cat heard a whisper in her mind, Why, my fierce one? You and I can win.

 Cat thought, But I don't want anyone to die!

 Ilya stood in front of Tarika, shielding her as he looked desperately from Cat to Ms. Arkan to Zoraida. Professor M rolled forward, a sword in one hand, but Cat had no time to wonder what he was planning. Ms. Arkan was aiming a pistol toward her.

 Cat thought, No! And her father, Ilya, Tarika, and Ms. Arkan stopped moving. She heard her mother's whisper: Well done. Saeed al-Rahman thrust his knife at Zoraida's heart. She caught his wrist and squeezed. The knife fell, and she said calmly, "Enough!" And Olujimi, Mr. Rahman, and Auntie Fong were still. Cat thought, What now? She heard, They're too dangerous.

 Zoraida's jaws opened. Her fangs glistened. Cat shouted, "You said you wouldn't kill!" Zoraida frowned. "My fury, we'll only bite them to bind them." "Won't glamming do?" "Better to bind, with so many." "Mama. Just glam them, okay?" And she heard the whisper: Why? She answered, Because you love me. Zoraida raised an eyebrow, and the reply came: It's a higher price than you know. Zoraida's fangs retracted. She told the glamoured humans, "Wait--"

 A motion behind her made Cat whirl. Baldomero was running toward a shattered window. In mid-step, he became a raven and beat his wings to fly. She screamed, "No!"

 But holding a raven's thoughts was like trying to hold grease in her fingers. She felt him slip free, saw him soar through the window, then saw her mother leap after him. A black wolf followed the raven to freedom. No! Not both-- She ran to the window. The sky was empty of anything but clouds. No one was racing across the yard. She glanced back in the dining room. The humans waited, obeying their last command. She turned back to the window, thinking, I've lost--

 Something moved below her. In the border of plants by the house, a black wolf held a struggling raven in its jaws.

 Cat said, "Mama? Don't kill him, okay?"

 The wolf shook its head and jumped back inside. As it landed, it became Zoraida de la Sombra with the raven gripped firmly between her hands. Cat heard, Then make him look human.

 You can't? You bit him. So I bought him? Zoraida smiled. It's easier for you to command one you bind. And harder for others.

 Cat stared into the raven's glittering eyes. "Baldomero. Look human again." Her head began to throb, as if her brain was being packed in ice. She thought, Bird brains are hard.

 Zoraida glanced at Professor M. Cat heard, Tell me about it. She said, "Free Dad? And Tee?" Zoraida nodded, and Tarika ran to stand by Cat, saying, "You good?" Cat nodded as Professor M said, "Zora, you should've just eaten the bastard." Zoraida's face tensed slightly. Cat thought, Baldomero's still her sister's son. Cat studied the raven, but she thought of the handsome man whose laugh had thrilled her. Some things Dad shouldn't joke about. But he's only seen the monster. He never saw any other Baldomero.

 Cat shook her head. "He's family." Professor M said, "Give him to me." "No," Zoraida said softly, and Professor M lifted his head just a fraction of an inch. Then Zoraida raised the raven before her and said, "Cat doesn't want you dead. But it would be easier for her to love your memory than you." She put one hand around the bird's skull.

 Cat said, "Mama!" Professor M said, "Trust her, kid." Zoraida told the raven, "Son of my beloved sister, if you are foolish enough to think I will not kill you to protect my child--" Baldomero stood before them, jerking his head to shake off Zoraida's hand as he gave a gentle, self-mocking smile. "Catalina, my princess, I don't need to rule. I could serve you. Happily." "If you could be trusted," said Zoraida.

 "Catalina bound me. She can trust me." "Bound, yes. Trust, no." Cat heard her mother's hint and said as forcefully as she could,

 "Baldomero! You can't change into anything. You can't use glamour. You can't attack anyone. You can only defend yourself if someone attacks you."

 He raised his eyebrows. "Death by starvation? You're crueler than I thought."

 She had meant her commands as a temporary solution. Were her only choices to kill him quickly or slowly?

 Zoraida told Baldomero, "Convince humans you deserve to live, and they'll share their blood. Pay them, and they'll sell it."

 "Beg for my life or buy it?" He smiled sadly. "No, thank you." His smile disappeared. "Catalina. You have every right to hate me. But, please, don't make me a puppet. If ever you loved me, even the tiniest bit, kill me."

 She couldn't kill him now that he was harmless. And she couldn't keep him harmless without feeling she was killing him.

 Zoraida said, "To the night folk, death is the honorable choice." Professor M said, "It sounds like the practical one." Cat shook her head. "I can't just--" Tarika said, "How long do ravens live?"

 They all turned to her. Zoraida said hesitantly, "In captivity, forty years. In the wild, fourteen."

 Baldomero nodded, his face proud, his eyes pleading. "The wild. It's little to ask."

 Cat glanced at her father. He shrugged. "Gone is gone."

 Her mother nodded. "Bound is bound. Give him a simple command, and he'll have to obey."

 "Forever?" "Or until you say otherwise." She looked at Baldomero and thought, Eyes like the night, with galaxies of promise. But she said, "Be a raven. Forever." "Thank--" he began. Then a raven bobbed to her as if bowing and launched itself into the deep blue sky. As it flew, Cat whispered,

 "Goodbye, Baldomero." Her father said, "Cat? You okay?" S h e s h o o k h e r h e a d , t h i n k i n g , T i a Y s a b e l 's d e a d , C o u s i n

 Baldomero's banished, and Tarika can't trust me because I nearly killed her twice. What do I lose next?

 She heard, My fury, we should go. Now? Why?

 What's here to keep us?

 Cat glanced at her father, then at the broken windows, and thought,

 Plus someone might notice the excitement. Zoraida shook her head. Glamour makes all things normal. Uh, how much of my mind can you read? Only what you direct at me. And the rare thought so strong you seem to scream it. Cat looked at her father and thought, Dad? He said, "What, kid?" She thought, Do you hear me? He said, "You need to sit? Or some water?" She said, "Coping," and thought, He can't hear me. You never bit him. I never bit you. No. I hear you because you bit me when I was a baby! You wanted to control me. To use me against Baldomero. Yes.

 But last night, you told me to be free. Yes. Mama? If you had me to use me-- Her mother's face became as mask-like as her father's had ever been.

 Cat glanced at him as she heard, That's not why I had you. Then why--

 Will you force me to answer? No. Then deal with what's here, my fierce one. Tarika watched them warily. Cat said, "Tee? If you want to go while it's safe--" Tarika's eyes went wide. "And miss the end of the show? No way." "It could still go wrong." "Kind of know that." Cat smiled, then faced the motionless forms of Uncle Olujimi,

 Auntie Fong, Mr. Rahman, Ms. Arkan, and Ilya. She took Ilya's pistol from his grip, put it on the table, and asked Zoraida, "Free him next?"

 "As you wish," Zoraida said.

 Ilya stumbled forward. He stared at Zoraida, then his gun, then Cat. "You can't trust nighters. Ever."

 "They can't trust humans." "They want our blood!" Zoraida smiled widely. "Top of the food chain, young Arkan." As Ilya glanced at his pistol, Cat said, "Mama, the not helpful."

 Zoraida shrugged. "It stays true. We all know it."

 Professor M said, "You've got two choices, Ilya. Trust Cat, or run like hell."

 Ilya said, "I won't leave my mother!" "I'm not planning for anyone to get hurt," Cat said. "How certain," Ilya asked with a hint of hesitation, "is this plan?" "Not very. But I want this whole thing over." He studied her. She thought, Brown eyes are common, but that doesn't mean they're not beautiful.

 He nodded. "I want this over, too." "So help." She began plucking pistols and knives from human hands. He frowned. "This plan is to make us defenseless?" Tarika took Auntie Fong's gun from her fingers and told Ilya, "Like you'd be less dead if you killed the nighter who killed you?" Cat said, "I just want everyone to think before they fight." Ilya said, "That's your plan? All of it?" "Waiting to hear a better one."

 Ilya glanced at Professor M, who shrugged and said, "We tried everything else. If thinking doesn't work, we can always go back to being stupid."

 Ilya sighed, then squinted at Zoraida. "Can I take her fangs?" Zoraida, laughing, told Cat, "I like this Arkan. He's funny." Ilya shook his head. "Nighters think I'm funny." Prying Ms. Arkan's pistol from her fingers, he said, "Sorry, Mother," and set it on the table with the others.

 Cat thought, Mama? If you said the truce was continuing, would all the nighters obey?

 If I did? Yeah. Now that Baldomero's gone, don't you rule? No. But who--? My fury, you bit him, you bought him. And all that goes with him. Cat jerked her head back in surprise. Her mother raised an eyebrow. You don't think I've been unusually helpful? I thought you loved me. That, too. So I'm, like-- La Reina de la Sombra. Queen of the family? Of the nighters. The nighters? Wait. All nighters? All nighters everywhere? Not a joke? Not a joke, my fury. Baldomero was at the top of a pyramid of bindings. When you bit him, all who were his became yours. They have to obey me, just like I'd bit them? In the realm of shadow, royal power is absolute. Cat looked at the ring of the Medianoches on her father's finger. So if I order nighters not to kill, they have to obey? Yes.

 Cat's father, Tarika, and Ilya were watching them. How long had the silent conversation with her mother taken? Five seconds? A minute? She said, "I'm the Queen of Shadows."

 Professor M glanced at Zoraida, When she nodded, he turned back to Cat. "You good with that?"

 No. Not yet. Maybe never, she thought, but she said, "Kind of have to be."

 Tarika smiled. "Then you'll be the best Queen of Shadows."

 Only a best friend would hear the hesitation in Tarika's voice. Cat tried to grin back, and hoped no one else saw how frightened she was.

 Ilya said, "What does it mean?"

 Making people do whatever I want? Being responsible for all the nighters? "Still working on that," she replied. 

 Chapter Seventeen

 : All Things End

 Looking at the tableau of Auntie Fong, Uncle Olujimi, Mr. Rahman, and Ms. Arkan, Cat thought, I could walk away and leave them frozen here, but she knew she couldn't. She asked her mother, "Okay, let everybody free now?"

 Zoraida shrugged, then nodded.

 Ms. Arkan immediately lunged for the pile of pistols and knives on the dining table. Olujimi caught her shoulder and jerked his chin at Zoraida, who showed her gleaming fangs in a grin, saying, "Alexandra Arkan. Do feel free to break the peace."

 "The peace ended when Cat became one of you!" Ms. Arkan said.

 "Technically," Professor M said. "But as an element of strategy, you might not want to point out that you're at war and unarmed."

 Ms. Arkan whirled to face Cat. "Girl--"

 "Queen Catalina or Your Majesty," Auntie Fong corrected. "If we must negotiate with the enemy, we must respect them too."

 "Not enemy," Cat said. "I want peace. Not a fight-until-one-side- wins peace. A real peace. And to prove it..." Cat took a deep breath. "My first queenly command is no nighter may kill a human."

 Zoraida said, "Then we'll be vulnerable to humans." "Except in self-defense," Cat added. Mr. Rahman said, "What if a nighter finds a way around your command?" "What if a human--" Zoraida flicked her chin toward Ms. Arkan and grimaced. "--exploits your command to kill nighters?" Tarika stepped forward. "You need a group of judges! So nighters who killed humans and humans who killed nighters could be judged by humans and nighters!"

 "Hmm," said Mr. Rahman. Tee should be queen, Cat thought. She heard her mother answer, Queens need advisers. "What power would the judges have?" asked Auntie Fong. Cat said, "Uh, nighters could be bound to live as a raven or a wolf for as long as the jury decides." "Or make them go to live by themselves in a wild place," Ilya suggested. "That would be good for humans and nighters both."

 "Or they could have to help people," Tarika added.

 "Liking the judges idea," Cat said as she turned to her mother. "Would it work?"

 Zoraida frowned. "If humans are about to break the peace, may nighters kill them?"

 "They'd still face a jury half full of humans." Auntie Fong said, "Even your mother?" Cat nodded. "Even me. Dad?" "Worth a try," he said.

 "Tee?"

 Tarika glanced at Cat with an expression she couldn't read. "Kind of icked about the messing with people's minds part." it."

 "The ditto. But if someone turned out to be innocent, we could undo

 Olujimi said, "You know how nighters learn to control their hunger."

 Cat shuddered, remembering how close she had come to killing Tarika in the B&B, then shook her head. "I'm proof it doesn't have to be that way."

 Professor M said, "Custom always trumps logic."

 "Okay, queenly command Number Two. Any nighter who lets another nighter kill will face the judges. Definitely including nighter parents."

 Mr. Rahman said, "What stops nighter judges from saying their kind are always innocent and ours, guilty?"

 Zoraida answered, "Wanting the peace to last." "Do nighters want that?" Zoraida nodded. "We're no fonder of dying than you." Ms. Arkan showed her empty hands, then told Olujimi, Auntie Fong, and Mr. Rahman, "The Arkans do not consent to this charade. Only one peace is certain--our victory, their extermination."

 Zoraida asked Cat, "Now I may kill her?" "Not if she doesn't attack you." Zoraida turned back to Ms. Arkan. "Say where you'd like to attack me, Arkan. I'll be waiting." Cat said, "Uh, Mama--" "Yes, the not helpful." Zoraida glanced at the clan leaders. "I'll go." Professor M said, "Zora." She shook her head. "My presence won't help them decide wisely." "You think I care about that?" She smiled. "No. But you should." Ms. Arkan pointed at Zoraida. "If that stays, I go." Professor M said, "Best reason yet to stay, Zora."

 Auntie Fong said, "Alexandra, we're still the Five Clans. The Medianoches are still our hosts." She turned to Professor M. "What do you say?"

 "Not my decision." He pulled off the turquoise ring, rolled close to Cat, and put it in her palm.

 Ms. Arkan said, "She's not their First!"

 Auntie Fong said, "The circumstances that required her to step down have changed--"

 "Not a bit!" Ilya said, "Mother! You saw and heard--" "A farce." Ms. Arkan pointed at Zoraida and Cat. "They can force us to trust them. That's why we never can." "If I'm so powerful," Cat said, "why haven't I glammed you into shutting up?" "Because you're a freak nighter playing some game--" "Okay." Cat slipped on the ring of the Medianoches. "Your game, your rules. Let's play." Ms. Arkan pointed at Zoraida. "It's clearly her game. She'll use you for her wishes--" Zoraida grinned. "Were that true, you would be my slave. My silent slave." Professor M said, "I believe Zora." As Zoraida glanced at him, Ms. Arkan said, "And that's a surprise?" "The surprise," Professor M said, "is it took me so long to figure it out. I knew Zora for a year and Granny Lupe for fourteen. Neither tried to bite or glamour me."

 "Because she bound you when you met, then made you forget."

 He shook his head. "I nearly killed Cat last night. If I'd been bound, Zora could've stopped me in a second. She could've made me kill Olujimi and Auntie Fong. She could've saved her sister." He studied Zoraida. "I'm sorry about that."

 Zoraida closed her eyes, then said, "That was war, not you."

 "And it's not over!" Ms. Arkan said. "Any fool can see she didn't need to bite you to enslave you!" She whirled to face the others. "How long must we endure this?"

 Auntie Fong took her previous seat at the table. "So long as the First of the Medianoches acts within our rules."

 "She's the queen of our enemies now!" Professor M said, "And the head of a clan." "Who was sentenced to die!" Olujimi sat on the right of Auntie Fong. "Who saved us from their king." Mr. Rahman sat on Auntie Fong's left. "The circumstances have changed."

 Ms. Arkan shook her head. "There's no reason to change her sentence."

 Tarika said, "Can I speak?" Cat nodded. "Anytime." Tarika told Ms. Arkan, "La Reina de la Sombra didn't agree to the sentence. Only the First of the Medianoches did." Ilya said, "May I speak?" Cat smiled. "Also the anytime." He said, "Firsts often withdraw their consent when circumstances change." Cat pointed at her ring. "Totally withdrawing." Ms. Arkan glared at Ilya, then smiled coldly. "Now we're the Four

 Clans. The Medianoches--" "Stay neutral until someone breaks the peace," Cat said quickly.

 "Being host means I can say the meeting's over?" Olujimi, Auntie Fong, and Mr. Rahman looked at Professor M, who nodded. "Those are the rules." Ilya said, "But you'll all look like fools if you don't vote again!" Ms. Arkan said, "Ilya--" Olujimi put his hand on the table. "Ilya's right." Olujimi glanced at

 Ms. Arkan. "The Udofias call for a new vote. Yes or no. Should Catalina, First of the Medianoches and Queen of Shadows, be killed?" He looked at them all. "The Udofias say no."

 Mr. Rahman slapped the table. "As do the Rahmans!"

 Ms. Arkan, glaring at Cat, hit the table so hard that cups and papers jumped. "The Arkans say yes!"

 "Not all Arkans," said Ilya.

 Auntie Fong glanced down, then said, "The Fongs abstain. Unless you vote against yourself, Catalina, you've won. The Fongs will honor the council's decision."

 Ms. Arkan nodded. "And the Arkans will honor it so long as the Medianoches stay in the Five Clans. Therefore I call for--"

 Cat said, "You can kick us out. It won't change what we do. And if I'm killed, the ring goes back to Dad." She turned to her mother. "What would happen to the nighters?"

 "I would rule," Zoraida said. "And I'd be very tempted to reconsider Baldomero's plan to enslave your race."

 Auntie Fong asked, "You threaten us?"

 "Never." Zoraida smiled innocently. "Only fools give warning before they strike."

 Professor M said, "Zora, not helpful." He faced the clan heads. "The chance for peace is small here. Don't screw up."

 Cat added, "Please."

 Ms. Arkan rolled her eyes, but Cat could not tell what Olujimi, Auntie Fong, or Mr. Rahman thought. Ms. Arkan said, "Let's end this. Yes or no. Do the Medianoches stay in the Five Clans? The Arkans say no!"

 "But the Rahmans say yes."

 "And the Udofias say--" Olujimi glanced at Cat. "Most definitely yes."

 Auntie Fong frowned at her. "Catalina, if the vote is two to two, you'll decide your own fate. Would you stay with so little support?"

 "Yes." "Why?" "Because you should never stop trying to work with people." Auntie Fong closed her eyes, then nodded at Mr. Rahman.

 "Sometimes, to win, you must do what frightens you. The Fongs say yes. The Five Clans stay the Five Clans."

 As Cat was about to sigh in relief, Ms. Arkan glared at Auntie Fong. "Not if the Arkans leave!"

 Ilya stood. "Mother, no!" "Must I name every Arkan that nighters have killed?" "If you're right, they'll break the peace, yes? Then you can have your war again." Ms. Arkan said in a tone so gentle it surprised Cat, "My son, if they break it by killing you, I'll blame myself always." "Blame me instead, Mother." As Ms. Arkan stared at Ilya, Zoraida said, "If the peace is broken, it'll be no nighter's fault. I promise that. On my honor." Ms. Arkan breathed deeply. "We'll test the honor of nighters. The

 Arkans accept the decision." Cat hesitated, expecting a trick. When she saw Ilya smile, she knew

 Ms. Arkan spoke the truth. She wanted to thank her, but before she could speak, Ms. Arkan glared at Cat as if she was the target on a shooting range. "It's postponed, not over." She glanced at the other clan leaders. "And when we pay for today's decision, I pray the price will be small." She stood and walked into the hall.

 Professor M leaned close to Cat. "On the long list of things Xandra doesn't get: Postpone something forever, and it's over."

 Cat gave him a small smile, but she thought, Can the peace last?

 The whisper came: I heard that, my fury. We only have to make peace last for a day. Then it'll last forever.

 Cat gave her mother a larger smile.

 "Sorry." Ilya stood suddenly and slipped his knife and pistol into the harness under his jacket. "I must go."

 "Ditto the sorry," Cat said, wondering if he guessed how sorry she was. She wanted to ask when he would return to Budapest, but knowing Ms. Arkan, she knew the answer. Immediately. Ilya was another addition to the list of all she was losing now.

 He turned and began walking quickly for the door, almost as if he wanted to run. Cat thought, Say something, Stupid. Then she wondered if she meant that to him or herself, and thought, Either stupid would do.

 She said, "Ilya?" He glanced back. "Thanks," she said, and thought, Definitely winner of the best eyes award.

 "I'll tell every Arkan about you," he said. "We'll hold my mother to the peace, I promise." Then she thought she saw him blush, and he hurried into the hall.

 She thought, I'll never see him again. Losing Baldomero's for the best, but losing Ilya--

 Zoraida rose to her feet, so smoothly she seemed to float upward. "If I wish to keep Alexandra from having her satisfaction--and I wish that dearly--I must tell the night folk they have a queen and peace."

 Cat said, "Now?"

 Zoraida smiled at her and Professor M. "I could not leave you in better hands, my fury." She turned, leaping toward the open window. A raven flew through it and disappeared into the darkening sky.

 Professor M called, "Zora!" as Cat thought, Mama! We need you!

 But whether the raven was too far away or it chose not to answer, Cat could not guess. She asked, "Will she come back?"

 Professor M said, "She loves you, kid. Give her time." Cat nodded, thinking, Lost Mama and Granny Lupe both. Tarika pushed her chair back. "I should go. The parental unit will worry." She smiled at everyone and started for the door. Cat thought, Tee, wait! Tarika stopped still. Cat was grateful until she saw Tarika's stillness was statue-perfect. She heard a desperate, panicked thought, Cat! Let me go!

 Horrified, Cat ordered, Be free!

 Tarika whirled to stare at her. Cat added, Tee, sorry, totally sorry! I didn't mean--

 You glammed me! By accident! Because I bit you. It won't happen again, I--

 Too many accidents, Cat. But I didn't mean it! I swear-- Kind of how accidents work. Tee, please-- Tarika shook her head. Got to go now, was the last thought Cat heard clearly as Tarika ran from the house. Cat thought, Mama, Ilya, Tee. Three strikes, I'm out. Olujimi, Mr. Rahman, and Auntie Fong were talking near the door.

 Professor M said, "I can make goodbyes for you, if you want." She said, "It's okay," while thinking, Not. But better to deal with being First of the Medianoches than think about how everything's better for everyone else and crummier for me.

 Mr. Rahman pointed at the broken windows. "I can nail some boards or tarps--"

 Professor M shook his head. "Thanks, Saeed. I'll call in some favors. We're good."

 Mr. Rahman turned to Cat. "The Medianoches have had many fine Firsts, Cat. As the one who brought peace, you'll be remembered as the greatest."

 She thought, Did any of them have friends? But he was being nice, so she said, "Thanks, Mr. Rahman."

 "If someday you forgive me, call me Saeed." "Okay, Saeed." He smiled, and Auntie Fong said, "I don't expect you to forgive me,

 Catalina. But I hope you'll believe me that I'm sorry I couldn't trust you."

 Cat shook her head, thinking, Don't want to be nice to someone who voted to kill me. But making peace means making people feel peaceful. "Hard to be mad at someone who was trying to protect everyone."

 Professor M said, "That's one way to look at it." Cat said, "Dad, it ended all right, right?" "For now," Auntie Fong agreed. "You have a huge task ahead of you." Cat thought of what she had lost. "I know." "No, dear. You can't begin to imagine it." Auntie Fong smiled slightly. "But you'll be up to it." Cat thought, No way, only they don't need to hear that. She returned the smile, and Auntie Fong went to stand with Mr. Rahman. Olujimi stepped toward them. "Cat. Val. What this day has done to the friendship of the Medianoches and Udofias is-- Well. I don't believe anything could hurt me as much." Professor M nodded. "Good."

 "If I can make up for it somehow--" Professor M pointed at the hallway. "Leaving's hard to beat." Olujimi frowned deeper. "I deserve that." Professor M shook his head. "You deserve nothing. You were my brother, but now--" "Dad!" Cat said. "You tried to kill me too!" "Which I'll live with for the rest of my life. I don't need him around besides." She looked from her father to Olujimi. "Forgiving you now, okay?

 Both of you." Olujimi said softly, "Thanks, Tiger." Professor M looked away, and

 Olujimi's face grew sadder. Then he nodded to Cat. "If ever--" "Dad," she said. "Olujimi apologized." "Apologies are easy." "No, Dad. They're not. They're really hard."

 He glanced at her. "Fair enough. Only no one has to accept an apology."

 Cat's throat felt thick, but she made herself speak normally. "Okay, they don't, but they should. Because sometimes things just go wrong. And, like, it's your best friend. And you should be able to apologize, so you do. But your friend won't forgive you, and it's like--" Her eyes were getting moist, so she blinked to make that stop. "It's like so stupid you can't believe it, and it hurts the worst of anything you've ever felt, and all you want is for everything to be like it was yesterday when you were best friends, only you can't make it be yesterday again, no matter how much you need it to be okay again--"

 Professor M said, "Cat--" "So say you forgive him!" "I can't just say--" "You can!" She gasped as the tears came, too strong to hold back.

 "You say you forgive him, and maybe you don't really, not completely, but you say it, and you act like you mean it, and then you both remember how good it was to be best friends, and maybe it can't be just like that again, but it doesn't have to be like the worst thing ever. And maybe it can be pretty good again. Or, you know, maybe, even better than ever. So forgive him. Please."

 "Cat--" "Dad! Forgive him!" Professor M inhaled, then turned to Olujimi. "Fine. I forgive you.

 But if you ever screw up again--" Cat said, "Dad! That's not forgiving!" Olujimi smiled. "It's something to build on, Tiger."

 Professor M told him, "You are much luckier than you deserve."

 Olujimi glanced at Cat, then back to her father. "Not the only one, Bro."

 Auntie Fong said, "Yes. She'll be a fine First." Then she, Mr. Rahman, and Olujimi smiled and went into the hall.

 Professor M cleared his throat and looked at Cat. "Seemed like Tarika rushed off."

 Cat said softly, "I commanded her accidentally." "To go?" "To stay. I undid it, but-- Maybe I shouldn't have a best friend now that I'm, you know." Professor M said carefully, "Tarika's got a lot to deal with, but--" "No dadly advice, Dad," Cat said. "Not right now, okay?" He reached over and squeezed her hand. "So, kid, what would you like for dinner? Spaghetti? We bought soy meatballs--" She shook her head. "Not hungry." "Not at all?" "I'm getting to know the signals, Dad."

 "Then that's the last time I'll ask twice."

 She made herself smile so he wouldn't worry. "I just want to go to my room and sleep."

 "You think--" He glanced out at the darkening sky. "Sure. Sounds like the best idea. Rest well."

 She nodded and, to her surprise, yawned. Maybe her room would be more than a place to hide. She kissed her father's forehead and went back through the very large, very empty, very quiet house that no longer felt like home.

 When she reached her room, she looked at the pictures of her birthday meals. In every one, she and Tarika hugged and grinned as if life couldn't get better. Professor M had always asked for a photo of the birthday duo, but Tarika had always insisted on the same pose.

 Think about it tomorrow. Cat pulled off her high-tops, fell into bed, dragged her purple blanket up over her shoulders, wondered if she would be able to sleep, and fell asleep immediately.

 *

 She woke with the sun warm on her face. She smelled potatoes frying. A mug of soy milk was by the clock on her bedside table with a note saying, "Happy Belated 14!"

 She thought, Right. Just me and the dad now. Well, that's okay. I mean, that's good. As good as it can be, anyway. So it's good.

 She drank the soy milk, thinking, Got to learn to control the glamour. And to be a raven and a wolf. I'll keep busy learning things. And making sure the peace doesn't fail. So it'll be lonely? Sometimes you just have to be lonely.

 She wrapped the blanket around herself, stepped into her slippers, and went downstairs. The curtains were still closed for the night, but the gloom fit her mood. Then the smell of garlic and peppers joined the potatoes, and she thought, Starving now. The best kind.

 In the kitchen, her father had his work chair cranked high so he could watch the skillet. He said, "Morning, sleepyhead. Since you didn't seem to mind garlic yesterday--"

 "Smells dee-double-icious, Dad." She put her empty mug in the sink. "Do you need something else? If vegetable protein doesn't cut it--" "Really not about to go bitey, Dad." "Sorry. Sometimes I'm Captain Overprotective."

 "Only sometimes?" She kissed his forehead. "I shouldn't have said anything. Could've gotten breakfast in bed every morning from the captain if I'd played that better."

 He added tofu to the skillet, then poured in salsa. "Tell you what. You get room service on one morning of your choice. Offer void in a year." He turned off the burner and looked in the oven.

 "Biscuits!" Cat said. "Best Dad Ever award!"

 "Fourteen years, and still number one." He took out a tray of perfect golden biscuits. "If you're up for serious scientific experimentation, grab margarine, honey, maple syrup, apple butter, and all the jam and jelly."

 "It's good to sacrifice for science."

 She devoured the tofu scramble and two biscuits, saying little more than, "That's great" and "Ginger preserves win," and "Wait, apple butter with cinnamon does," and "I really haven't been fair to the orange marmalade."

 When she pushed her plate away, her father said, "Only two biscuits?"

 "Resting. Then ginger preserves and rose hip jelly enter the death match."

 "An impeccable plan."

 She broke open a third biscuit, looked up, and said, "I don't want to be the Queen of Shadows."

 He frowned at her. "Kid, any idiot can be royalty." "Real comforting." "And you're no idiot." "Better."

 "What's the problem? Don't they have to do what you say?" "Yeah. It'd be like having slaves." "Oh." He pursed his lips, then said, "Normally, I'd admire your democratic impulse, but in this case, I think being aware of that is what'll make you a great queen."

 "Isn't that like being a great slaveowner?" "Kid, they're nighters." "Dad, so am I." "Oh." He tapped his fingers on his coffee cup, then pushed the ginger preserves and rose hip jelly closer to her plate. "You really don't want to be queen?"

 She nodded. "Except I have to. So I'll do it." He shook his head. "Abdicate." "And let Mama take over?" "If Zora wanted to be queen, she would've made you a princess." "Then who? Wouldn't anyone else be worse?"

 He shook his head. "Free them all. Say it's democracy time, but if anyone tries to restore the monarchy, they'll answer to the same judges that try nighters for murder. Getting people to try something new is tough, but--" He blinked. "What?"

 She realized she was staring at him. "The nighter prophecy. One born between the worlds will lead the folk to glory."

 "Huh." Professor M picked up his coffee cup, then set it down without drinking. "Make this work, and it'll be plenty glorious to me."

 She threw her arms around him, and after a moment, his arms closed around her. "Kid, this is a lot to bear, no matter how we do it."

 She nodded, then jerked back from him. "A B&B!" "What?" "We should start a Bed and Breakfast!" "Huh. That's better than Olujimi's idea."

 "For what?" "Professor Midnight's Museum of Marvels." She nodded. "Professor Midnight's B&B of Marvels." "Well. We'll think about it." "Dad?" "Hmm?" "Yesterday? The nighters showing up just in time to save me was kind of a coincidence." "Coincidences happen. That's why they're called coinci--" "If you wanted to reach Mama, could you?" He inhaled deeply. "I've got Granny Lupe's cell and e-mail." "So, yesterday, did you--"

 He nodded. "After you said she freed you, I figured out why she bit you."

 Cat squinted at him.

 "It wasn't to control you. It was to make sure no one else could. So I took a chance and called her. She tried to sneak out, but Baldomero bound her and learned what was up. If anyone hears I told a nighter about a meeting of the clans--"

 "Totally our secret. Dad?" "Kid?" "Great biscuits. Just saying." She crammed the last bite into her mouth as the doorbell rang. Professor M hit his forehead. "I forgot to pay the paper guy! Kid, tell him I'll be there as soon as I find the checkbook, okay?" "Sure thing." Cat ran to the front door and swung it wide. On the porch, jaw set as if for battle, stood-- "Tee?" Cat said, then thought, Right. She would think it was cowardly not to tell me to my face that our friendship's over.

 Tarika said, "I came to say--" Cat nodded. "Our friendship's over." "Because I freaked yesterday?" Tarika stared. "So not fair!" "It's not over?" "I came to say I was sorry about the freaking." "But I nearly killed you twice, and then I ordered you--" "But you couldn't help that!" "But you didn't know that!" They stopped simultaneously. Cat said, "You, first." Tarika said, "No, you." "I can't make you do anything now that I freed you. That's how it works." "What about talking in my head?" "I don't know." "Try." Cat thought, Tee? Tarika grinned. The cool! We can talk in school in separate classrooms! So we're good? We're best. Cat smiled. You're the best. Tarika said aloud, "Why, yes, I am the best. And you know why?" Cat shook her head. "Look what I brought." Ilya stepped out from behind a porch pillar. "Hi," he said shyly.

 "Hiding was Tee's idea." "You're not gone?" Cat said, then thought, What is it about him that makes me ask the stupidest questions?

 He patted his chest and arms, then head, then smiled. "I think I am all here."

 Tarika said, "He's not going!" Cat said, "I thought Ms. Arkan--" Ilya nodded. "She wanted to leave Tucson when the Cat Medianoche problem was solved. But it's not solved, so we must stay." He grinned at Cat. "I hope this problem lasts forever."

 Cat thought, Tee? Uh, you liked Ilya first. Would it be cool--

 Tarika answered, For you to settle for him because I am so going to convince Trick Zapia he's cool enough for a girl who's taller than he is? Why not?

 Cat heard her father rolling behind her and turned. He said, "So, what does the birthday girl want?"

 She squeezed Tarika's hand, then smiled at Ilya. "The birthday girl got it."

 "Huh," Professor M said. "That was easy. I was sure we would have to--"

 "Movie, miniature golf, Thai restaurant, and no talking about nighters or clans or the Ouroboros War all day?" Cat asked.

 Her father nodded. And that was what they did.
