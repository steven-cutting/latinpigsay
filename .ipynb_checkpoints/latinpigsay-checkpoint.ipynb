        "For many people ( myself among them ) , the Python language is easy to fall in love with . Since its first appearance in 1991 , Python has become one of the most popular dynamic , programming languages , along with Perl , Ruby , and others . Python and Ruby have become especially popular in recent years for building websites using their numerous web frameworks , like Rails ( Ruby ) and Django ( Python ) . Such languages are often called scripting languages as they can be used to write quick-and-dirty small programs , or scripts . I don\u2019t like the term \u201cscripting language\u201d as it carries a connotation that they can not be used for building mission-critical software . Among interpreted languages Python is distinguished by its large and active scientific computing community . Adop- tion of Python for scientific computing in both industry applications and academic research has increased significantly since the early 2000s . For data analysis and interactive , exploratory computing and data visualization , Python will inevitably draw comparisons with the many other domain-specific open source and commercial programming languages and tools in wide use , such as R , MATLAB , SAS , Stata , and others . In recent years , Python\u2019s improved library support ( primarily pandas ) has made it a strong alternative for data manipulation tasks . Combined with Python\u2019s strength in general purpose programming , it is an excellent choice as a single language for building data-centric applications .\n"
