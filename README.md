latinpigsay
===========

This project is aimed at being very similar to the classic Linux program
[*Cowsay.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) 
This tool will, when completed, function very much the same way as cowsay,
except, that latinpigsay will translate the provided input into Pig Latin.

I'm hoping to further improve the accuracy of the translator, currently I think
it is plenty fast.

The current version of the translator and printer can translate and print [*War
and Peace*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600) in under 2.5 minutes --on a 
six year old laptop.


**Note**:
This project is still very rough and under early development.
But, the translator does work and so does the 'piggyprint' module.
